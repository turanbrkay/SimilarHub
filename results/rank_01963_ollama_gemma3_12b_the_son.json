        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins in 1849, following young Eli McCullough's abduction by the Comanches, who raise him as one of their own. He experiences a brutal introduction to their culture and way of life, forging a complex relationship with his adoptive Comanche family while simultaneously grappling with his lost identity and the memory of his biological parents. Sixty years later, the narrative shifts to Eli as an aging patriarch struggling to protect his vast cattle empire during the Bandit Wars, a period of intense lawlessness and conflict in South Texas. He faces challenges from rival ranchers, ruthless bandits, and the changing political landscape, all while haunted by the events of his youth and the legacy of violence he has inherited.
