        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Joanna and Alistair, a married couple, arriving in a remote Australian town to house-sit for a friend. Their young baby, Noah, vanishes from his cot during the night, triggering a frantic search and a police investigation. As the investigation progresses, suspicion falls on both Joanna and Alistair, and their pasts are gradually revealed, exposing a history of trauma and secrets. Joanna suffers from a recurring nightmare, a manifestation of her deep-seated anxieties and unresolved issues. The narrative alternates between the present-day investigation and flashbacks to the couple's life in London, where they experienced a previous tragedy. As the search for Noah intensifies, the couple's relationship deteriorates, and they are forced to confront their own demons and the possibility that one of them may be responsible for the baby's disappearance. The truth surrounding Noah’s disappearance is tied to a past trauma and a desperate attempt to escape a haunting memory, ultimately revealing a complex web of guilt and denial.",
