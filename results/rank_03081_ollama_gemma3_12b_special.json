        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Ryan, a man with cerebral palsy, living a sheltered and dependent life, largely controlled by his mother and caregiver. He presents himself as an accident victim to gain sympathy and manipulate situations to his advantage. However, as the series progresses, Ryan begins to question his fabricated persona and the impact it has on his relationships. He embarks on a journey of self-discovery, confronting his past traumas and challenging the limitations imposed upon him. Through a series of increasingly bold actions, Ryan attempts to gain independence and pursue romantic interests, often with disastrous and comedic consequences. He navigates complex relationships with his family, friends, and potential partners, ultimately grappling with the question of whether true happiness can be found through deception or genuine self-acceptance.
