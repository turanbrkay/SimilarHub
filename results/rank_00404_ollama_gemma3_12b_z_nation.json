        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins three years after a viral outbreak has decimated the United States, leaving hordes of zombies roaming the country. Murphy, the patient carrying the potential cure, is a charismatic and dangerous figure who has become a zombie himself, retaining his intelligence and leadership abilities. A team led by Roberta Warren is assembled to escort him to a research facility in California. Their journey is fraught with peril, encountering various factions of survivors – some helpful, others hostile – and battling relentless waves of zombies. Along the way, they pick up a diverse group of companions, each with their own motivations and secrets. Murphy's influence grows, and he manipulates events to further his own agenda, often pitting the team against each other. The team faces numerous setbacks and losses, forcing them to adapt and evolve their strategies. As they approach California, they discover that the situation is far more complex than they initially believed, and the fate of humanity hangs in the balance. The series explores the moral ambiguities of survival and the corrupting influence of power, even in a world overrun by the undead.",
