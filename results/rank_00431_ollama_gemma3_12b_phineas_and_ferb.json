        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Phineas and Ferb, two imaginative stepbrothers, determined to make the most of their summer vacation. Each day, they embark on ambitious projects, ranging from building rollercoasters to creating time machines, much to the frustration of their older sister, Candace, who desperately tries to get them 'busted' to their mother. Simultaneously, their pet platypus, Perry, leads a double life as a secret agent, battling the nefarious Dr. Doofenshmirtz and his elaborate schemes to conquer the Tri-State Area. Throughout the series, the brothers' inventions often lead to unexpected consequences and encounters with fantastical creatures and alternate realities.

The overarching narrative focuses on the enduring power of imagination and the importance of family, even amidst constant chaos and sibling rivalry.",
