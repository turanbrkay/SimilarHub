    "overview": "Babylon 5 is a five-mile long space station located in neutral space. Built by the Earth Alliance in the 2250s, its goal is to maintain peace among the various alien races by providing a sanctuary where grievances and negotiations can be worked out among duly appointed ambassadors. A council made up of representatives from the five major space-faring civilizations - the Earth Alliance, Minbari Federation, Centauri Republic, Narn Regime, and Vorlon Empire - work with the League of Non-Aligned Worlds to keep interstellar relations under control. Aside from its diplomatic function, Babylon 5 also serves as a military post for Earth and a port of call for travelers, traders, businessmen, criminals, and Rangers.",

Early seasons focus on establishing the station's inhabitants and the delicate balance of power between the Earth Alliance, the Minbari, the Centauri, the Narn, and the enigmatic Vorlons. Tensions escalate as the Narn Regime attempts to overthrow the Centauri Republic, leading to a devastating war. Earth's political landscape becomes increasingly unstable, with a shadowy organization known as the Psi Corps gaining influence and manipulating events. As the series progresses, it is revealed that the Vorlons and Shadows, ancient and powerful entities, are manipulating the younger races, setting the stage for a larger galactic conflict. The Earth-Minbari War, a pivotal event in the series' history, is revisited and its true causes are uncovered, revealing a deeper conspiracy. The final season culminates in a devastating war between the Alliance and the Shadows, with the fate of the galaxy hanging in the balance. Ultimately, sacrifices are made, alliances shift, and the future remains uncertain, leaving a lasting impact on the characters and the universe.",
