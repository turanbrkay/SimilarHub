The show blends action and adventure with a complex narrative, examining the moral ambiguities of westward expansion and the forging of a new nation.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Cullen Bohannon seeking retribution for his wife's death at the hands of Union soldiers. He joins Hell on Wheels, a mobile boomtown that accompanies the construction of the transcontinental railroad, intending to use the project to track down those responsible. As the railroad progresses, Bohannon becomes entangled in the schemes of industrialist Durant, who manipulates events to secure his own wealth and power. The railroad's construction disrupts the lives of Native American tribes, leading to violent confrontations and alliances. Bohannon's quest for revenge evolves into a broader struggle for control of the railroad and its impact on the nation. Throughout the series, alliances shift, betrayals are revealed, and characters grapple with their own moral compromises as the railroad pushes westward, reshaping the landscape and the lives of those involved. Bohannon's personal journey is intertwined with the larger narrative of westward expansion, ultimately leading him to confront his past and redefine his purpose.",
