        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Barry Berkman, a Midwestern hitman, sent to Los Angeles to eliminate an executive. While carrying out the assignment, he inadvertently enrolls in an acting class taught by Gene Cousineau. Barry finds himself drawn to the world of acting, seeing it as a potential escape from his violent past. He attempts to build a new life, balancing his hitman duties with his acting aspirations, a precarious situation that leads to numerous complications and near-exposures. As Barry becomes more involved in the acting community, he forms complex relationships with his classmates, including Sally Reed, a struggling actress, and NoHo Hank, a charismatic and surprisingly empathetic member of the Chechen mob. Throughout the series, Barry's attempts at reinvention are constantly undermined by his past, forcing him to confront the consequences of his actions and the difficulty of escaping his true nature. The series explores the cyclical nature of violence and the challenges of genuine change, culminating in a confrontation with the forces that have shaped Barry's life and a reckoning with his own identity.",
