        "analytical_summary": "Late Night with Conan O'Brien is a long-running American late-night talk show known for its absurdist humor, quirky segments, and celebrity interviews. The show distinguished itself with a more offbeat and improvisational style compared to traditional late-night formats. Conan O'Brien's energetic and playful hosting, often paired with Andy Richter's sardonic commentary, created a unique comedic dynamic. The show's musical performances, led by The Max Weinberg 7, added another layer of entertainment. Ultimately, the show's success led to O'Brien's transition to The Tonight Show.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The show's format revolved around a nightly mix of monologues, celebrity interviews, musical acts, and recurring comedic bits. Conan O'Brien's initial partnership with Andy Richter formed a core element of the show's humor, with Richter serving as a foil to O'Brien's often-manic energy. Over the years, the show developed a reputation for its willingness to experiment with unconventional segments and embrace a more improvisational style. As the show progressed, the announcement of O'Brien's departure to take over The Tonight Show marked a significant turning point, leading to a transition of power and the arrival of Jimmy Fallon to continue the Late Night franchise.",
