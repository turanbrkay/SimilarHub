        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Olivia, feeling disillusioned with her life choices, impulsively decides to swipe right on every potential match on a dating app. This leads to a chaotic and humorous series of dates with 252 different men, each encounter offering a unique perspective on love, life, and happiness. As Olivia navigates these diverse relationships, she begins to question her initial motivations and confronts the underlying reasons for her regret. She experiences a range of interactions, from awkward first encounters to surprisingly meaningful connections, ultimately realizing that the pursuit of a perfect match isn't the key to fulfillment. Throughout her journey, Olivia learns valuable lessons about herself, the importance of genuine connection, and the need to embrace the present rather than dwelling on the past. While she doesn't necessarily find 'the one,' she gains a deeper understanding of what she truly desires in a partner and in life, leading to a more mature and self-assured outlook.",
