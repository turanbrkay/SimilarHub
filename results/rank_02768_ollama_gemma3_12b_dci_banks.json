        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series follows DCI Alan Banks, a brilliant but troubled detective, and his dedicated partner, DS Annie Cabbot, as they tackle a series of challenging cases in East Anglian city of Copperhaugh. Early seasons establish Banks' unconventional methods and his strained relationship with his superiors, often clashing due to his tendency to bend the rules in pursuit of justice. Annie, initially skeptical of Banks' approach, gradually comes to respect his instincts and becomes a vital asset to his investigations. Throughout the series, the detectives confront a range of criminals, from violent offenders to sophisticated con artists, each case revealing deeper layers of corruption and deceit within the city. Personal tragedies and professional setbacks test the detectives' resolve, forcing them to confront their own demons while striving to maintain their commitment to upholding the law. Recurring characters, including forensic specialists and local law enforcement officials, add complexity to the investigations and contribute to the overall sense of a tightly-knit community grappling with crime and its consequences.
