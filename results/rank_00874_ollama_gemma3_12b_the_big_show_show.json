        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Paul Wight, having retired from wrestling, attempting to adjust to life as a suburban dad in Florida.

Throughout the first season, Paul and his wife, Melissa, face typical family conflicts, including sibling rivalry, school-related anxieties, and the challenges of balancing work and family responsibilities. Paul's attempts to connect with his daughters often lead to humorous misunderstandings and awkward situations, as he tries to bridge the gap between his past life and his present role. As the series progresses, the family members learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and Paul gradually earns the respect and affection of his daughters, demonstrating the power of family bonds and the importance of embracing change. While specific episodic events are humorous and relatable, the overarching narrative arc focuses on the family's journey towards greater understanding and unity.",
