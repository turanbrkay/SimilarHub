        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the introduction of Kitty, Margot, Bree, and Olivia, seemingly disparate students united by a shared desire to address the pervasive bullying and injustice within their high school. Following a traumatic event, they form DGM – Don’t Get Mad, Get Even – a clandestine group dedicated to exposing wrongdoers through elaborate and anonymous pranks. Initially, their actions target obvious bullies and perpetrators of petty crimes, bringing a sense of satisfaction and a perceived restoration of balance. However, as the group’s actions escalate, they uncover deeper, more complex layers of corruption within the school and community, involving teachers, administrators, and even the students' families. The girls grapple with the moral implications of their actions, facing internal conflicts and external pressures as their identities are threatened and the consequences of their vigilantism become increasingly severe. The series explores the unraveling of their carefully constructed facade as secrets are revealed and the lines between justice and revenge become increasingly blurred, ultimately forcing them to confront the true cost of their actions and the potential for their own downfall.",
