        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series centers on Detective John River, who is haunted by the death of his colleague and best friend, Jackie Redcoat. River experiences vivid and often disturbing visions of Jackie, which he uses to solve crimes but also contribute to his own unraveling. The initial case involves the murder of a teenage girl, and River's investigation is complicated by his grief and the suspicion of his superiors. As he delves deeper into the case, River finds himself increasingly isolated and at odds with the police force, blurring the lines between his professional duty and his personal struggles.
