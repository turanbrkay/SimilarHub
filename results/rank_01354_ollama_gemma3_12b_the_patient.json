        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Dr. Alan Strauss, a recently retired therapist, being abducted and held prisoner in a remote basement by Sam, one of his former patients. Sam reveals himself to be a serial killer struggling with his urges and requests Alan's help in curbing his homicidal tendencies. As Alan attempts to treat Sam through unconventional methods, he is forced to confront his own past traumas and the ethical dilemmas inherent in his profession. Flashbacks reveal Alan's history with his husband Tom, and the profound grief he still carries. Sam's past is gradually revealed through therapy sessions, showcasing a history of abuse and a deeply fractured psyche. Alan's attempts to help Sam are complicated by the constant threat of violence and the realization that Sam's urges are deeply ingrained. The series explores the cyclical nature of trauma and the difficulty of breaking free from destructive patterns. As Alan delves deeper into Sam's mind, he risks losing himself in the darkness, blurring the lines between therapist and prisoner, sanity and madness.
