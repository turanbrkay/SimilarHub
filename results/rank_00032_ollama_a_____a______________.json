        "analytical_summary": "American Horror Story is a bold anthology horror drama that reimagines classic macabre tropes across a rotating cast and setting each season. The series blends supernatural dread with psychological depth, exploring themes of identity, trauma, and the dark underbelly of human desire. Its tone oscillates between eerie suspense and sharp satire, while its narrative structure allows for both serialized arcs and self-contained stories. With a reputation for pushing genre boundaries, the show has become a cultural touchstone for modern horror storytelling.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Season 1 opens in a haunted house where a family of newcomers confronts a murderous past, setting a tone of domestic terror. Season 2 shifts to a psychiatric asylum where institutional abuse and supernatural forces collide, revealing hidden secrets of the staff and patients. Season 3 presents a coven of witches battling internal power struggles and external threats, while Season 4 showcases a freak show where the performers grapple with exploitation and supernatural curses. Season 5 centers on a glamorous hotel that becomes a nexus for ghostly hauntings and human ambition, and Season 6 explores a rural farmhouse tied to the mysterious disappearance of the Roanoke colony. Season 7 delves into a cult that worships a demonic entity, and Season 8 confronts a post-apocalyptic world where survivors face both human and supernatural dangers. Season 9 revisits a summer camp that becomes a battleground for a vengeful entity, and Season 10 revisits the hotel with a new twist. The series continues to evolve with each iteration, maintaining its anthology format while expanding its mythos.",
