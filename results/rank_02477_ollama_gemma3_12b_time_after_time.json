After Stevenson escapes justice, Wells uses his newly invented time machine to pursue him to modern-day New York City. The chase spans decades, with Wells grappling with the moral implications of his actions and the difficulty of bringing a criminal to justice across time. Stevenson, meanwhile, adapts to the modern world, exploiting its opportunities while continuing his pattern of manipulation and violence.
