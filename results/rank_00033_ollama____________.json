Through its action-packed storytelling, it portrays complex relationships between Geralt, the sorceress Yennefer, and the young princess Ciri, while weaving a larger narrative of prophecy and power struggles across kingdoms.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Season 1 opens with Geralt’s encounters with the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg and the young princess Ciri, introducing the world’s political tensions and monster-hunting contracts. The season culminates in the battle at Kaer Morhen, where Geralt confronts the Wild Hunt and the Red Queen’s forces, while Yennefer’s past is revealed and Ciri’s destiny hinted at.
