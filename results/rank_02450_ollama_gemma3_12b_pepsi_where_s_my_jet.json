        "analytical_summary": "Pepsi, Where's My Jet? is a documentary series chronicling the bizarre legal battle initiated by a man who believed he won a fighter jet in a Pepsi promotional contest. The series blends elements of true crime, legal drama, and social commentary, exploring themes of corporate responsibility, consumerism, and the pursuit of justice. It offers a darkly comedic and often unsettling look at the lengths people will go to for a seemingly impossible dream, and the potential for exploitation within promotional campaigns. The series' tone is a mix of absurdity and genuine frustration, highlighting the clash between individual ambition and corporate power.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series centers on Corey Harris, who, in 2017, believed he had fulfilled the requirements of a Pepsi promotional contest offering a McLaren 720S. After repeated attempts to claim his prize, Corey realized the contest was a hoax, designed to generate social media engagement. He then initiated a lawsuit against Pepsi, arguing that the company had created a legally binding contract through its promotional materials. The legal proceedings become increasingly complex and protracted, with Corey representing himself against Pepsi's legal team. The series follows Corey's relentless pursuit of his claim, documenting his struggles with the legal system, the media attention he receives, and the emotional toll the case takes on him and his family. The series culminates in a court ruling that, while acknowledging Pepsi's deceptive practices, ultimately denies Corey the fighter jet, leaving him feeling betrayed and disillusioned.",
