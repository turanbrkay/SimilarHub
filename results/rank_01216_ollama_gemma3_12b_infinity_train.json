        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Jesse Pinkman, a troubled young boy, boarding the Infinity Train after stealing a mysterious amulet. He quickly discovers that the train operates on a unique system: passengers must spend 'compass points,' earned by solving puzzles and helping others, to progress to the next car. He is joined by Miles, a sentient robot, and Tulip, a young girl seeking revenge for her family's loss. As they journey through the train's increasingly bizarre and challenging cars, they encounter a variety of other passengers, each with their own reasons for being on board and their own personal struggles. Jesse grapples with his past actions and the consequences of his choices, while Miles develops a deeper understanding of human emotions and Tulip confronts the complexities of vengeance. Throughout their travels, they uncover fragments of the train's history and the enigmatic figure of the Conductor, who seems to hold the key to their ultimate fate. The journey forces them to confront their inner demons and learn the value of empathy and forgiveness, ultimately leading them closer to understanding the true nature of the Infinity Train and their place within it.",
