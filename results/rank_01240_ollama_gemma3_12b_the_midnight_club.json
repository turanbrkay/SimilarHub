        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the arrival of Ilonka, a young woman seeking a cure for her condition and a place within the mysterious Brightwood Manor. She discovers a clandestine group, the Midnight Club, who meet nightly to tell horror stories, believing that sharing these tales will summon the supernatural and potentially grant them a wish. As the club members share their stories, each narrative intertwines with the overarching mystery of Brightwood Manor and its dark history, revealing secrets about its founders and the supernatural forces at play. The stories themselves often reflect the club members' fears and desires, blurring the line between reality and imagination. Throughout the series, the club members investigate the manor's past, uncovering a complex web of secrets and lies that threaten their safety and well-being. The investigation reveals a connection between the manor's past and the club members' own illnesses, suggesting that their fates are intertwined with the supernatural forces that reside within Brightwood. As the series progresses, the club members face increasingly dangerous situations, both within their stories and in the real world, leading to a confrontation with the forces that seek to control them. The series culminates in a desperate attempt to break free from the manor's influence and confront the truth about their own mortality.",
