    "overview": "A pair of detectives investigate stalkers in Los Angeles.\n\nStrong and focused, Lt. Beth Davis is an expert in the field of repeated harassment, driven by personal experience of being a victim. She heads the LAPD's Threat Assessment Unit, which investigates cases of stalking -- including voyeurism, cyberharassment and romantic fixation. The history of recent transfer Jack Larsen -- whose personality and questionable behavior have been an issue in the past -- may help him in his assignment to her team. Her other detectives are young but eager Ben Caldwell and deceptively intelligent Janice Lawrence. Together they try to stop situations from spinning out of control -- and to keep their personal obsessions at bay.",

        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Lieutenant Beth Davis, a seasoned expert in stalking, establishing her Threat Assessment Unit within the LAPD. Her team includes the recently transferred Detective Jack Larsen, whose troubled past and unconventional methods often clash with Davis’s more structured approach. Each episode typically focuses on a new stalking case, revealing the escalating tactics employed by the stalkers and the emotional toll on their victims. Recurring storylines involve Jack’s personal demons and his attempts to prove himself to Davis, while Janice Lawrence’s sharp intellect and Ben Caldwell’s eagerness contribute to the team’s investigative efforts. As the series progresses, the team confronts increasingly complex and dangerous situations, uncovering the dark underbelly of obsessive behavior and the potential for violence. While individual cases are resolved within each episode, overarching narratives explore the team's evolving dynamics and the personal struggles of its members, particularly Beth's ongoing battle to balance her professional responsibilities with her own past trauma. The series examines the blurred lines between obsession and love, and the devastating consequences of unchecked fixation.",
