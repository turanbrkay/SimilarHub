    "overview": "Ed Goodson, a forthright and opinionated dad, relishes expressing his unsolicited and often wildly politically incorrect observations to anyone within earshot.

When Henry finds he can no longer afford to pay rent to his pretty roommate -- and secret admirer -- Sam, Ed reveals a soft spot and invites Henry to move in with him. Henry agrees, knowing that the verbal assault will not abate and now there will be no escape.",
