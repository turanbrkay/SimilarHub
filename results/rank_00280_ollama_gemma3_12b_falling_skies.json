        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with a sudden, widespread alien invasion that leaves much of the human population incapacitated. A group of survivors, led by former history professor Tom Mason, form the 2nd Massachusetts Militia to protect their community and fight back. Early seasons focus on establishing the militia, understanding the aliens' motives and technology, and rescuing captured civilians. The aliens, known as the Bes, are revealed to be harvesting humans for an unknown purpose, leading the militia to undertake increasingly dangerous missions to disrupt their operations. As the series progresses, the militia discovers a potential weakness in the Bes' technology and begins to develop strategies to exploit it. Internal conflicts arise within the militia, as differing ideologies and personal losses strain relationships. Later seasons introduce new alien factions and reveal more about the origins of the invasion, leading to a desperate final push to liberate humanity. The series concludes with a complex resolution involving sacrifice and a fragile hope for the future, leaving the ultimate fate of humanity uncertain.",
