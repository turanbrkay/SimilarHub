        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins by introducing Sophie Toscan du Plantier, a French woman living in West Cork, Ireland, and her relationship with Ian Bailey, an English journalist. Following Sophie's brutal murder on Christmas night in 1996, the investigation quickly focuses on Bailey as a person of interest. The documentary meticulously details the initial police investigation, the subsequent arrests and releases of Bailey, and the legal battles that ensued. The series highlights the inconsistencies in witness testimonies and the challenges of gathering evidence in a rural setting. Bailey is initially arrested but released due to lack of evidence.
