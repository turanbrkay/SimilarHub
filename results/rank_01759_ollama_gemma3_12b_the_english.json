        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Lady Cornelia Locke, an aristocratic Englishwoman, arrives in the American West seeking vengeance for her son’s death, which she blames on a ruthless outlaw named Eli Wirtham. She is guided by a former Royal Marine, Arnold, who is haunted by his own past. Their journey intertwines with that of a Pawnee man, Odie, who is also seeking justice for his people. As they travel, they encounter various dangers and injustices, including corrupt lawmen, opportunistic settlers, and the harsh realities of frontier life. Cornelia’s quest for revenge leads her to confront not only Eli but also the deep-seated prejudices and violence that define the West. Along the way, she forms an unlikely bond with Arnold and Odie, finding a sense of purpose and belonging in their shared struggle. The series reveals a conspiracy involving powerful figures who manipulate events to exploit the land and its people, forcing Cornelia, Arnold, and Odie to confront a larger system of oppression. Ultimately, their individual quests for justice converge, leading to a confrontation that challenges their beliefs and forces them to make difficult choices about the future.",
