        "analytical_summary": "After Life is a darkly comedic drama exploring grief, cynicism, and the search for meaning in the face of profound loss. The series follows Tony, a local journalist who, after the death of his wife, adopts a nihilistic worldview and attempts to punish the world with his unfiltered thoughts and actions. While initially presented as a bitter and abrasive character, the series gradually reveals Tony's vulnerability and his reliance on the kindness of those around him, ultimately examining the importance of human connection and finding reasons to live even in the darkest of times. The show blends humor and pathos, offering a poignant and often uncomfortable reflection on mortality and the complexities of human relationships.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Tony Johnson, a journalist for the Tambury Gazette, grappling with the sudden death of his wife, Lisa. Consumed by grief and despair, he contemplates suicide but instead decides to live long enough to inflict pain on the world, believing he has nothing left to lose. He adopts a deliberately offensive and cynical persona, pushing away friends and family and openly expressing his negative thoughts. Throughout the first season, Tony’s behavior causes friction with his colleagues, his daughter, and his friends, but he remains stubbornly resistant to their attempts to help him. As the series progresses, however, Tony begins to realize that his attempts at punishment are ultimately futile and that he is, in fact, dependent on the support of those around him. He slowly starts to re-engage with his life, finding solace in unexpected connections and rediscovering a sense of purpose. Subsequent seasons explore Tony’s continued journey through grief and his evolving relationships, showcasing his attempts to find meaning and connection while confronting the ongoing pain of loss. While the series maintains a darkly comedic tone, it ultimately offers a hopeful message about the resilience of the human spirit and the importance of finding reasons to live.",
