They are juggling the responsibilities of parenthood with the complexities of maintaining their relationship and friendships. Each episode typically revolves around a seemingly ordinary situation that quickly spirals into a surreal and often chaotic adventure. They encounter a wide range of eccentric characters, from talking animals to bizarre creatures, and find themselves embroiled in increasingly outlandish scenarios.
