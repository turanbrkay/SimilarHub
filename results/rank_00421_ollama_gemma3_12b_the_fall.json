        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the discovery of a series of murders in Belfast, initially treated as separate cases. Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson is brought in from London to review the investigation, quickly identifying a pattern and realizing a serial killer is at large. The police investigation focuses on identifying the perpetrator, while simultaneously attempting to prevent further deaths. The killer, Paul Spector, is a seemingly ordinary family man who meticulously plans and executes his crimes, demonstrating a chilling lack of empathy. As Gibson and her team close in, Spector manages to evade capture, often manipulating the investigation to his advantage. The narrative alternates between Gibson's perspective, as she analyzes evidence and profiles the killer, and Spector's, revealing his motivations and methods. Spector’s actions have devastating consequences for his family and the victims’ loved ones. The investigation becomes increasingly complex, with Spector exploiting weaknesses in the police force and manipulating those around him. Eventually, Spector is apprehended, but the aftermath reveals the lasting impact of his crimes and the challenges of bringing closure to those affected. The series explores the psychological damage inflicted on both the victims and the investigators, highlighting the enduring nature of trauma and the difficulty of achieving true justice.",
