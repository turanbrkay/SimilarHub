        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with a group of singles, selected for their attractiveness and desire for a romantic getaway, arriving at a luxurious tropical resort. They are immediately informed of the central rule: any sexual activity, including kissing, will deduct from the prize fund. Throughout the season, contestants navigate romantic feelings and the temptation to break the rules, leading to both humorous and frustrating moments. Alliances and rivalries form as individuals strategize to maximize their share of the prize. As the season progresses, the prize fund dwindles due to rule violations, creating tension and forcing contestants to confront their motivations. Ultimately, a select few remain, and the final prize distribution reveals the winners, highlighting the consequences of their choices and the dynamics of the group.",
