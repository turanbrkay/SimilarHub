        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Abe Woodhull, a New York farmer, witnessing a brutal act of violence by British soldiers, prompting him to seek revenge and aid the American cause. He forms the Culper Ring with his childhood friends, including Caleb Brewster and Simcoe, initially operating as a network of informants relaying information to General George Washington. As the war progresses, the ring expands, incorporating new members like Anna Strong and James Abe, each bringing unique skills and vulnerabilities. The group faces constant challenges, including the threat of exposure by British Major Hewlett, who relentlessly hunts down spies. Internal conflicts arise as loyalties are tested and personal relationships become entangled with the dangerous mission. Caleb’s involvement with British sympathizers creates a significant rift within the group, while Anna’s role as a signalman puts her in constant peril. The series culminates in a desperate attempt to uncover a major British plot, leading to betrayals, sacrifices, and a reckoning with the true cost of freedom. While the American cause ultimately prevails, the personal toll on the members of the Culper Ring is profound, leaving them forever marked by the secrets they kept and the lives they risked.",
