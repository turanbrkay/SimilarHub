        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Deborah Vance, a celebrated but aging Las Vegas comedian, struggling to connect with a younger audience and facing a career crisis. Her agent, desperate to revitalize her act, pairs her with Ava, a recently fired, entitled 25-year-old writer. Initially, their relationship is marked by animosity and misunderstanding, as Deborah sees Ava as naive and privileged, while Ava views Deborah as a relic of a bygone era. As they begin to collaborate on a new stand-up routine, they reluctantly begin to understand and respect each other, uncovering shared vulnerabilities and past traumas. Ava’s past, including a difficult family history and a history of impulsive behavior, gradually comes to light, revealing the reasons behind her cynicism and self-destructive tendencies. Deborah, in turn, confronts her own regrets and the compromises she made throughout her career. The series follows their evolving dynamic as they navigate professional challenges, personal crises, and the complexities of their burgeoning mentorship, ultimately forging an unlikely bond that challenges their preconceived notions and forces them to confront their own demons. The initial tension between them gives way to a complicated, supportive, and sometimes adversarial relationship, as they both strive for professional success and personal growth.",
