        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Frank Reagan assuming the role of Police Commissioner, inheriting both the responsibilities of the department and the expectations of his family. The Reagans, including his sons Danny and Jamie, and his daughter Erin, each navigate their own roles within the NYPD and the legal system. Early seasons focus on establishing the family dynamics and showcasing their individual approaches to law enforcement, often clashing with each other's methods and beliefs. As the series progresses, the Reagans confront increasingly complex cases and political pressures, forcing them to question their values and the integrity of the justice system. Recurring conflicts arise from differing opinions on how to handle criminals, the influence of corruption within the department, and the personal sacrifices required to maintain their positions. Later seasons delve into the legacy of Frank's father, Henry, and the challenges of upholding his reputation while facing modern-day issues. The series explores themes of loyalty, betrayal, and the enduring impact of family history on their professional lives, culminating in a continued commitment to serving and protecting New York City.",
