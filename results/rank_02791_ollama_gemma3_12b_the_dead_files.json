        "analytical_summary": "The Dead Files is a paranormal investigation series that blends the perspectives of a psychic medium and a former homicide detective. Each episode focuses on a location believed to be haunted, with Amy Allan experiencing psychic impressions and Steve DiSchiavi conducting a traditional investigative analysis. The series distinguishes itself by the two investigators working independently and not sharing their findings until the very end, creating a suspenseful reveal of whether the location is genuinely haunted and, if so, the nature of the haunting. The show's format emphasizes a balance between spiritual and rational approaches to paranormal phenomena, appealing to audiences interested in both the supernatural and investigative storytelling.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Each episode of The Dead Files follows a consistent structure. Amy Allan, a psychic medium, is brought to a location reported to be haunted. She conducts a series of psychic investigations, experiencing visions and receiving impressions about the history and potential spirits present. Simultaneously, Steve DiSchiavi, a retired NYPD homicide detective, conducts a traditional investigation, interviewing witnesses, researching historical records, and examining physical evidence. Crucially, Amy and Steve work in isolation, not sharing their findings with each other. At the episode's conclusion, they reveal their independent assessments. Amy details her psychic impressions, often describing the identities and stories of the spirits she perceives. Steve presents his findings, connecting historical events and potential causes of the haunting. The final reveal determines whether the location is deemed haunted and, if so, the nature and severity of the paranormal activity. While the series doesn't feature ongoing narratives or character arcs, each episode presents a self-contained investigation with a distinct resolution regarding the presence and nature of supernatural phenomena.",
