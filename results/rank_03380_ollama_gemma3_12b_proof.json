As Julian delves deeper into Project Eden's work, he uncovers a complex web of ethical compromises and hidden agendas, realizing that his quest for proof may have unforeseen and potentially dangerous consequences. He begins to question the true nature of his research and the motivations of those around him, facing moral dilemmas that challenge his beliefs and threaten to consume him.
