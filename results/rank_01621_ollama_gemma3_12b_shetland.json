The series blends procedural elements with character-driven narratives, offering a slow-burn, atmospheric viewing experience that emphasizes the impact of crime on a small, interconnected society. Shetland distinguishes itself through its realistic portrayal of policing in a remote location and its focus on the psychological toll of investigations.",
