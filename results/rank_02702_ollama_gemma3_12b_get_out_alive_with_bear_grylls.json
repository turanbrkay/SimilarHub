The teams must then race against each other, utilizing limited resources and relying on their survival skills to reach designated checkpoints and ultimately the finish line. Along the way, they face a series of physical and mental challenges designed to test their limits, including navigating treacherous landscapes, building shelters, finding food and water, and overcoming obstacles. Teams are often forced to make difficult decisions, such as rationing supplies or choosing between different routes, and alliances and rivalries often develop as the competition intensifies.
