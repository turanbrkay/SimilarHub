        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Raimy Sullivan, a New York City police detective, attempting to honor her deceased father, Frank, by repairing his old ham radio. Through a bizarre anomaly, she establishes contact with Frank, who is transmitting from 1996. They quickly realize they can communicate and, more importantly, that Raimy has the opportunity to prevent the tragic accident that claimed Frank’s life. By altering the past, Raimy inadvertently creates a ripple effect, changing the present in significant ways, including her own family history and career. As they work together to navigate these altered timelines, they uncover a larger conspiracy surrounding the radio anomaly and the events leading to Frank’s death. The changes to the timeline create new dangers and challenges, forcing them to confront the ethical implications of their actions and the potential for unintended consequences. The series explores the complexities of causality and the delicate balance of the universe, ultimately questioning whether some events are destined to occur and whether the pursuit of a better past is worth the risk of jeopardizing the future.",
