        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Molly Novak, a woman accustomed to a life of luxury and superficiality, suddenly finding herself with a massive divorce settlement. Initially, she approaches her charitable foundation with a detached and somewhat clueless attitude, attempting to fulfill her legal obligations without genuine engagement. However, through interactions with the foundation's employees, particularly the dedicated and passionate team leader, Sofia, Molly begins to confront her own lack of purpose and the emptiness of her previous existence. She slowly starts to understand the impact of the foundation's work and develops a genuine desire to make a difference. Along the way, Molly navigates awkward social situations, confronts her ex-husband's attempts to manipulate her, and forms unexpected friendships with the foundation staff. As she becomes more involved, Molly uncovers secrets about her late parents and the origins of her wealth, leading her on a journey of self-discovery and forcing her to re-evaluate her values. The series culminates in Molly taking a more active and meaningful role in the foundation, demonstrating a profound personal transformation and a commitment to using her wealth for positive change.",
