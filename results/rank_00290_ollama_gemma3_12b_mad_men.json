        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins in 1960, introducing Don Draper, a brilliant but enigmatic advertising executive at Sterling Cooper. Don's fabricated past and carefully constructed persona are central to the show's mysteries, gradually unraveling throughout the seasons. The initial seasons focus on the cutthroat world of advertising, the changing social landscape, and the personal struggles of the characters as they navigate infidelity, alcoholism, and professional ambition. As the 1960s progress, Sterling Cooper undergoes significant changes, including a merger with Cutler Gleason and a subsequent acquisition by McCann Erickson. Don's personal demons continue to haunt him, leading to periods of self-destruction and attempts at redemption. The later seasons explore themes of identity, loss, and the search for meaning in a rapidly changing world. Don's past catches up to him, forcing him to confront the truth about his origins and the lies he has built his life upon. The series concludes with Don embarking on a cross-country journey, ultimately finding a moment of clarity and a renewed sense of purpose, leaving his ultimate fate ambiguous.",
