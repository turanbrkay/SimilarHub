        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Tara, a seemingly ordinary woman, returning home to Iowa after her mother's suicide. It quickly becomes apparent that Tara suffers from dissociative identity disorder, manifesting in a variety of distinct personalities, each with their own behaviors, memories, and desires. These alters, including 'T,' 'Buck,' and 'Alice,' emerge at different times and under varying circumstances, often disrupting Tara's relationships with her husband, Derek, and her three teenage daughters, Gemma, Kate, and Faith. As the series progresses, the family attempts various therapeutic interventions to manage Tara's condition, but these efforts are often complicated by the unpredictable nature of the alters and the underlying trauma that fuels them. The show delves into Tara's past, revealing the origins of her dissociative disorder and the events that led to her mother's suicide. Relationships within the family are strained as each member grapples with the challenges of living with Tara's condition, and secrets are revealed that further complicate their understanding of one another. While the series explores the possibility of integration and healing, it also acknowledges the enduring impact of trauma and the ongoing struggle to find stability and connection.",
