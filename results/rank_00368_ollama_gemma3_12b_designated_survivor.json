        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with a catastrophic bombing at the U.S. Capitol during the State of the Union address, killing the President and most of his cabinet. Tom Kirkman, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, is unexpectedly sworn in as President due to his designation as the 'Designated Survivor.' He immediately faces immense pressure to maintain order, identify the perpetrators, and prevent further attacks. As Kirkman struggles to lead, a dedicated FBI team, led by Special Agent Hannah Wells, investigates the bombing, uncovering a complex conspiracy that reaches far beyond a single act of terrorism. The investigation reveals connections to a shadowy group with ties to past government actions and a desire to destabilize the nation. Kirkman grapples with difficult decisions, balancing his desire for justice with the need to protect national security, often clashing with his advisors and facing political opposition. Throughout his presidency, he confronts numerous threats, both domestic and international, while also dealing with personal sacrifices and the constant scrutiny of the media. The search for the masterminds behind the attack becomes a central, ongoing narrative thread, with numerous suspects and red herrings along the way. While the initial focus is on the bombing, the series expands to explore broader themes of political corruption and the fragility of democracy.",
