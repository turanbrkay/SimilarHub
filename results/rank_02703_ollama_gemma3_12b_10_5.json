        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The film introduces Dr. Samantha Hill, a brilliant but unorthodox seismologist whose theories about earthquake prediction are dismissed by her colleagues. When a series of unusual seismic events begin to occur along the West Coast, Samantha’s warnings are initially ignored. As the situation escalates, and the potential for a massive earthquake sequence becomes undeniable, Samantha is reluctantly put in charge of a team tasked with developing a plan to mitigate the disaster. The team faces numerous obstacles, including bureaucratic red tape, scientific disagreements, and the inherent unpredictability of geological phenomena. Samantha must convince skeptical authorities and rally her team while battling the clock and the looming threat of widespread destruction. The film culminates in a desperate attempt to implement a plan to stabilize the fault lines, with the fate of millions hanging in the balance. While the plan is risky, it represents the last hope for preventing a catastrophic event that could reshape the West Coast.",
