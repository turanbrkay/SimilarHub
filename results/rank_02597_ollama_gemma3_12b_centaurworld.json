        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with a warhorse, known only as Horse, fleeing a devastating war and desperately seeking a way back to her own world. She is magically transported to Centaurworld, a land governed by a narcissistic and controlling ruler known as the Nowhere King. To return home, Horse must navigate the Nowhere King’s trials and unite the fractured tribes of Centaurworld, each representing a different musical genre and personality. Along the way, she forms a band of misfit centaurs – a slacker, a shy healer, a vengeful warrior, a flamboyant performer, and a naive optimist – who become her unlikely family. As they journey across the land, they confront their own personal demons and learn to embrace their differences. The Nowhere King’s influence is revealed to be more insidious than initially perceived, manipulating the centaurs and exploiting their vulnerabilities. Ultimately, Horse and her band must confront the Nowhere King in a climactic musical battle, not only to escape Centaurworld but also to liberate its inhabitants from his control, leading to a bittersweet resolution that acknowledges the lasting impact of trauma and the importance of found family.",
