As she confronts her past, she discovers a disturbing connection to a secretive cult known as the 'Kindred.' The Kindred has been operating in the shadows for decades, believing they are preparing for a prophesied event. The series follows Adi's investigation into the cult's activities, uncovering a network of seemingly ordinary people who are deeply involved in their plans. She learns that her own family has been intertwined with the Kindred for generations, and that she may hold the key to stopping them. As Adi delves deeper, she uncovers a complex web of secrets and lies, and begins to question her own sanity. The Kindred's plan involves gathering children, believing they are essential for their master plan, and Adi must race against time to prevent them from carrying it out. The series culminates in a confrontation between Adi and the cult's leaders, revealing the full extent of their beliefs and the devastating consequences of their actions. While the immediate threat is addressed, the series hints at the possibility that the Kindred's influence may extend far beyond what is initially revealed.",
