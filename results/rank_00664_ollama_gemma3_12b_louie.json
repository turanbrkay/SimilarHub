        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Louis, a recently divorced comedian, struggling to balance his career with raising his two daughters, Lily and Jane. Early episodes focus on his attempts to co-parent effectively, often leading to awkward and humorous situations. As the series progresses, Louis's personal life becomes increasingly complex, with explorations of past relationships, fleeting romances, and the challenges of maintaining meaningful connections. The show frequently deviates from traditional narrative structures, incorporating experimental segments, surreal interludes, and moments of profound introspection. Louis grapples with feelings of isolation and regret, often confronting uncomfortable truths about himself and the world around him.

The later seasons see Louis confronting his own mortality and the fragility of human relationships, culminating in a series of episodes that reflect on his life and legacy.",
