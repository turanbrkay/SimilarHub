        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Each episode of Celebrity Family Feud follows a consistent structure. Two celebrity families are selected to compete. A survey question is posed to the first family, and they attempt to guess the top answers. If they succeed, they earn points and the opportunity to 'steal' from the opposing family. The process repeats until one family reaches a predetermined score, triggering a final round where they can win a larger cash prize. The show's format ensures a predictable but engaging dynamic, with the humor derived from the contestants' responses and their attempts to outwit each other. While there are no overarching plotlines, each episode culminates in a winner and a loser, creating a sense of closure within the short timeframe.",
