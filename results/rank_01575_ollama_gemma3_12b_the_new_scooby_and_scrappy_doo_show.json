        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series follows Scooby-Doo, Shaggy, Daphne, Fred, and Velma, along with the addition of Scrappy-Doo, as they work as reporters for a teen magazine. Each episode presents a new mystery, often involving supernatural creatures or seemingly paranormal events. The gang investigates these occurrences, uncovering clues and employing disguises and traps to expose the culprits, who are invariably ordinary people attempting to perpetrate hoaxes or cover up their misdeeds.
