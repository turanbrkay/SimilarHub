        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Jim Worth relocating to Little Big Bear, Alberta, to escape a troubled past in London. He assumes the role of police chief, initially finding the town peaceful. However, the arrival of migrant workers for a nearby oil refinery disrupts the tranquility, bringing with it a surge in crime, including drug trafficking and prostitution.
