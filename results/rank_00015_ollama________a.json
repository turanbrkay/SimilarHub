        "analytical_summary": "Euphoria follows Rue Bennett, a high‑school sophomore battling opioid addiction, as she navigates a hyper‑stylized, emotionally raw world of love, friendship, and self‑discovery. The series juxtaposes the glittering veneer of social media with the gritty realities of trauma, identity crisis, and drug‑culture, using vivid visual motifs and a non‑linear narrative to amplify its themes of sexuality, mental health, and empowerment. Through a diverse ensemble—ranging from the queer, fiercely independent Jules to the toxic, power‑driven Nate—Euphoria explores the complexities of teenage life in contemporary America with unapologetic intensity and surreal, cinematic flair.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The first season opens with Rue’s descent into drug use after a suicide attempt, revealing her fragile relationship with her mother and the complex dynamics of her friends. As the series progresses, Rue’s drug‑induced hallucinations intertwine with her real‑world struggles, while Jules’s journey of self‑acceptance and Cassie’s vulnerability in a toxic romance unfold in parallel. Season two deepens the characters’ entanglements: Nate’s violent obsession with control escalates, Maddy’s social‑media‑driven identity spirals, and Kat’s rebellious streak leads to dangerous choices. The third season intensifies the stakes, with Rue confronting her addiction in a hospital setting and the group dealing with escalating trauma, culminating in a dramatic, ambiguous climax that leaves Rue’s fate uncertain and the narrative poised for a potential continuation or resolution.",
