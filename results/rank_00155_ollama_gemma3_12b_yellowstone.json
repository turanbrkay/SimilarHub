Kayce, a former Navy SEAL, struggles to reconcile his military past with his family's ranching life, while Beth, a ruthless businesswoman, acts as John's enforcer, fiercely protecting the family's interests. Jamie, an ambitious lawyer, navigates the treacherous world of politics, often caught between his family's desires and his own aspirations. As the seasons progress, alliances shift, betrayals surface, and the Duttons engage in increasingly desperate measures to secure their legacy, leading to escalating conflicts and profound consequences for all involved.
