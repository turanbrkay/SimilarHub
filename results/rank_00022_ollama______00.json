        "analytical_summary": "The 100 follows a group of juvenile delinquents sent from a dying Earth to test whether humanity can survive on a post‑apocalyptic planet. Over seven seasons, the narrative shifts from survival drama to political intrigue, exploring themes of morality, leadership, and the cost of freedom. The series balances action with character‑driven moments, ultimately culminating in a time‑travel twist that questions the nature of reality and the possibility of redemption.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series opens with the 100, a group of 100 teens, launched from the Ark to a seemingly habitable Earth. They encounter hostile ground tribes, form fragile alliances, and confront internal power struggles, leading to the fall of several leaders and the rise of new ones such as Clarke, Bellamy, and Octavia. As the seasons progress, the 100 uncover an underground network of survivors, a looming nuclear threat, and a complex political landscape that includes the New World and the Ark’s governing council. The final season introduces a time‑travel device that allows the 100 to journey to a future where humanity has rebuilt but is on the brink of a second apocalypse. They discover a group of future citizens who have devised a plan to prevent the nuclear war, but the future is revealed to be a simulation designed to test humanity’s resilience. The series concludes with the 100 returning to the past, leaving the ultimate fate of Earth ambiguous while hinting that the cycle of survival and rebirth may continue.",
