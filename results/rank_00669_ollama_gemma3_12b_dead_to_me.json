        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Jen Harding, reeling from the sudden loss of her husband, Doug, in a hit-and-run accident. Struggling with grief and anger, she attends a grief support group where she meets Christina Morrow, a seemingly cheerful and optimistic woman who quickly befriends her. As Jen and Christina’s bond deepens, Jen discovers that Christina is harboring a dark secret: she, too, is grieving the loss of her husband, and her pain is intertwined with a past crime. Christina's seemingly innocent nature masks a complex history, and her presence complicates Jen's already fragile emotional state. Throughout the series, secrets are revealed, alliances shift, and the two women find themselves entangled in a web of deception and shared trauma. The initial investigation into Doug's death is reopened, revealing new suspects and raising questions about Christina's involvement. As the truth about the hit-and-run emerges, the women must confront their pasts and make difficult choices that will determine their futures, ultimately leading to a confrontation with the person responsible for Doug’s death and a reckoning with the consequences of their actions.",
