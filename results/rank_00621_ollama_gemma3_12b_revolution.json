        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins fifteen years after a global blackout that abruptly shut down all electricity. Nora, living a relatively peaceful life with her uncle, is thrust into danger when a militia group, the Patriots, kills her father, Miles, believing him to be a traitor. She soon learns that Miles was a key figure in the scientific community attempting to understand and potentially reverse the blackout. Joined by a group of survivors including Sebastian, a former soldier, and Rachel, a skilled medic, Nora embarks on a perilous journey to uncover the truth behind the blackout and Miles's involvement. They discover that the Patriots, led by Colonel Neville, are consolidating power and controlling the remaining technology, believing they are restoring order. As the group travels, they encounter various factions vying for control, including the Children of Gaia, a peaceful community living off the land. Nora and her companions uncover a conspiracy involving a powerful energy source and a secret organization manipulating events from the shadows. The journey leads them to confront the Patriots and expose their lies, ultimately revealing a deeper truth about the blackout's origins and the potential for restoring electricity, though at a significant cost and with uncertain consequences for the future of the world.",
