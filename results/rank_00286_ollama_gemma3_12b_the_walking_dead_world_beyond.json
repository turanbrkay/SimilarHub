Driven by a desire to find Felix and uncover the truth behind his departure, the trio, along with their friend Scout, defy the authority of their leader, Elizabeth, and embark on a cross-country journey. Their travels lead them through various dangerous territories, encountering hostile groups and uncovering the dark secrets of the Civic Republic, a seemingly advanced and organized settlement. They discover that the Civic Republic is not the utopia it appears to be, and that Felix’s research holds significant implications for the future of humanity. The group faces betrayals, losses, and moral dilemmas as they navigate the complexities of the post-apocalyptic world, ultimately confronting the consequences of their choices and the true nature of the threat they face.
