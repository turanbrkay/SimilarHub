        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Each episode of The World According to Jeff Goldblum focuses on a different subject, from sneakers and ice cream to coffee and dogs. Jeff Goldblum begins by introducing the topic, often with a personal anecdote or observation. He then embarks on a journey to uncover the history, science, and cultural significance of the subject, interviewing experts, visiting factories, and exploring hidden corners of the world. The narrative unfolds as Goldblum connects seemingly disparate elements, revealing surprising relationships and unexpected insights. For example, an episode on ice cream might trace its origins from ancient Persia to modern-day artisanal shops, highlighting the evolution of flavors and production techniques. The series consistently demonstrates how even the most familiar things have complex and fascinating stories behind them, culminating in a broader understanding of the world and its interconnectedness. The journey is less about a definitive conclusion and more about the process of discovery itself.",
