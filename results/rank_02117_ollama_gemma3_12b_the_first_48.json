The series begins with the discovery of the body and the immediate response from police, showcasing the initial assessment of the crime scene and the gathering of preliminary evidence. Detectives then work to identify potential suspects, often relying on witness interviews, forensic analysis, and surveillance footage. The series highlights the investigative process, including the challenges of tracking down leads, overcoming dead ends, and building a case strong enough to secure an arrest. While the series doesn't follow a traditional narrative arc, each episode culminates in the apprehension of a suspect, though the legal proceedings that follow are not typically shown.
