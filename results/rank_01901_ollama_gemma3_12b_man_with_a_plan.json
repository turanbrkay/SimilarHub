        "analytical_summary": "Man with a Plan is a sitcom centered on a man adjusting to the realities of full-time parenting when his wife returns to work. The series explores the challenges and humorous mishaps of balancing childcare, household responsibilities, and personal aspirations. It blends familiar family sitcom tropes with a focus on the evolving dynamics between a husband and wife and their children.

        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Adam, a successful advertising executive, believing he has a handle on parenting. However, his perspective dramatically shifts when his wife, Andi, returns to her career, leaving him as the primary caregiver for their three children. Initially, Adam struggles immensely, facing chaos and comedic disasters as he attempts to manage school drop-offs, meal preparation, and extracurricular activities. He relies heavily on his eccentric and overbearing father, Jim, for support, leading to further comedic clashes and unconventional parenting methods. Throughout the series, Adam gradually learns to appreciate the complexities of fatherhood, developing a deeper understanding of his children's needs and forming stronger bonds with them. Andi, meanwhile, navigates the challenges of balancing her career with her family responsibilities, leading to occasional conflicts and compromises. The series explores the evolving relationship between Adam and Andi as they learn to navigate their new roles and redefine their partnership. While comedic mishaps and family squabbles are constant, the underlying theme revolves around the growth and resilience of the family unit.",
