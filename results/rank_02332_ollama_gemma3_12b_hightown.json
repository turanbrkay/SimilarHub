        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Jackie Quinones, a recovering addict working for the National Marine Fisheries Service, discovering a body washed ashore. Her involvement in the investigation, despite resistance from the state police, quickly exposes her to the pervasive drug trade plaguing Cape Cod. As Jackie digs deeper, she uncovers connections between the victim and powerful figures within the community, including local politicians and business owners. The investigation becomes increasingly personal as Jackie confronts her own demons and past traumas, blurring the lines between her role as an investigator and her own struggles with addiction. Throughout the series, a larger conspiracy emerges, revealing the extent of the drug network and the lengths to which those involved will go to protect their operations. The series explores the ripple effects of the drug trade on the community, impacting families and individuals across different social strata.
