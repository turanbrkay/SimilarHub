        "analytical_summary": "White Lines is a neo-noir crime drama series set against the backdrop of Ibiza's vibrant and hedonistic club scene. The series follows Zoe Walker as she investigates her brother's disappearance, uncovering a web of secrets, lies, and criminal activity. It blends elements of mystery, thriller, and social commentary, exploring themes of family, identity, and the dark underbelly of privilege. The series utilizes a non-linear narrative structure, gradually revealing connections between past and present, and creating a suspenseful and morally ambiguous atmosphere.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Zoe Walker receiving a package containing a cassette tape from her estranged brother, Marcus, who has been missing for 20 years. The tape leads her to Ibiza, where she begins to unravel the circumstances surrounding his disappearance. As Zoe investigates, she discovers that Marcus was deeply involved in the island's drug trade and had connections to a powerful network of criminals. The narrative jumps between the present-day investigation and flashbacks to the 1990s, revealing Marcus's rise within the criminal underworld and the events leading up to his vanishing. Zoe's pursuit of the truth puts her in danger, forcing her to confront her own past and the complex relationships between the characters. The investigation reveals a conspiracy involving multiple individuals, blurring the lines between victim and perpetrator. Ultimately, the series explores the cyclical nature of violence and the enduring consequences of past actions, with a final confrontation that exposes the truth behind Marcus’s disappearance and Zoe’s own connection to the events.",
