        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series chronicles the Son of Sam killings, a string of murders that terrorized New York City in the 1970s. Initially, the investigation focuses on the seemingly random nature of the crimes, but journalist Maury Terry becomes convinced that the perpetrator, David Berkowitz, was part of a larger, organized group. Terry's relentless pursuit leads him down increasingly complex and unsettling paths, exploring connections to Satanic rituals and potential accomplices. He interviews Berkowitz extensively, attempting to unravel the truth behind his claims of demonic possession and uncovering a web of seemingly disparate individuals who may have been involved. The investigation consumes Terry's life, straining his personal relationships and blurring the lines between professional duty and personal obsession. While Berkowitz is ultimately apprehended and convicted, Terry remains unconvinced that the case is truly closed, believing that the full extent of the conspiracy remains hidden. The series culminates in a re-examination of the evidence and a lingering sense of unease about the true nature of the crimes.",
