The tone is generally hopeful, despite the bleak setting, emphasizing the resilience of the human spirit and the power of connection.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Gus, a young boy born with antlers and other deer-like features, being raised in the wilderness by his adoptive father, who tragically dies. Forced to venture out, Gus encounters Jepperd, a hardened traveler who reluctantly becomes his protector. They journey towards a rumored 'Greenmarch,' a safe haven for hybrid children, facing hostility and capture along the way. Gus's existence sparks the attention of the Last Men, a group dedicated to eradicating hybrids, and Dr. Aditya Singh, a scientist researching the origins of the plague and the hybrids. As Gus delves deeper into his past, he discovers a complex history involving scientific experimentation and a hidden community of hybrids. He learns that his existence is tied to a controversial research project led by his biological father. The series follows Gus's evolving understanding of his identity and his role in a world grappling with fear and prejudice, culminating in a confrontation with those seeking to exploit or destroy the hybrid population. While the future remains uncertain, Gus's journey fosters hope and inspires others to challenge the prevailing intolerance.",
