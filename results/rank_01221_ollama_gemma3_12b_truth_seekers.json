The show blends elements of mockumentary, found-footage horror, and science fiction, exploring themes of family, belief, and the search for truth. While initially presented as lighthearted and humorous, the series gradually reveals a larger, more sinister conspiracy with potentially global implications, escalating the stakes and introducing elements of suspense and danger. The show's tone shifts from quirky and observational to increasingly tense and mysterious as the protagonists delve deeper into the supernatural.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Dave, a widower and amateur paranormal investigator, and his teenage son, Gus, launching an online channel to document their ghost-hunting adventures across the UK.

As they dig deeper, they uncover a hidden network of individuals involved in paranormal research and a shadowy organization with a vested interest in suppressing the truth. Gus discovers that his father was previously involved in a top-secret government program studying paranormal activity, and that his mother's death may not have been accidental. The duo's investigations lead them to uncover a global conspiracy involving ancient artifacts and powerful forces beyond human comprehension. They face numerous threats and dangers as they attempt to expose the truth, ultimately confronting a powerful entity that threatens the entire world.
