        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Jake Epping, an English teacher, discovering a time portal in a diner. He is tasked by the diner's owner, Al Templeton, to travel back to 1958 and prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Upon arriving in the past, Jake assumes the identity of a local teacher and begins to investigate Lee Harvey Oswald, meticulously documenting his movements and attempting to thwart his plans. He also develops a deep connection with a local woman, Elizabeth, and builds a life for himself in the past, complicating his mission and creating a profound emotional attachment to the era. As Jake gets closer to 1963, he faces numerous obstacles and near misses, realizing that altering the past is far more complex than he initially believed. He encounters resistance from individuals who seem determined to ensure Kennedy's death, and he grapples with the moral implications of his actions. The closer he gets to November 22, 1963, the more he understands that his presence in the past is creating unforeseen consequences and that his mission may be more dangerous than he initially anticipated. Ultimately, Jake must confront the reality that changing history comes at a significant personal cost, and he faces a heartbreaking choice that will determine the fate of the future.",
