        "analytical_summary": "The Good Doctor follows Shaun Murphy, a brilliant but socially challenged surgeon with autism and savant syndrome, as he joins a prestigious hospital’s surgical unit in San Jose. Facing skepticism from colleagues, Shaun leverages his exceptional diagnostic skills and meticulous attention to detail to save lives while gradually learning to navigate complex human relationships. The series balances intense medical cases with themes of inclusion, resilience, and personal growth, offering a heartfelt, realistic portrayal of a modern healthcare environment. Over multiple seasons, it explores the evolving dynamics between Shaun, his mentors, and his love interest, while confronting ethical dilemmas and the challenges of living with a disability.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Shaun Murphy arrives at St. Bonaventure Hospital as a surgical resident, initially clashing with the department’s senior staff and battling a hospital board that questions his suitability. Early episodes establish his diagnostic genius, highlighted by a high‑stakes case involving a brain tumor patient, and his difficulty with social cues, which leads to a series of misunderstandings and a gradual acceptance by Dr. Claire Browne and Dr. Aaron Glass. Over subsequent seasons, Shaun tackles increasingly complex surgeries, including a heart transplant and a pediatric oncology case, while navigating personal relationships—particularly a budding romance with Claire—and confronting a rival surgeon who attempts to undermine him. The narrative also follows the development of a mentorship under Dr. Mark, the introduction of a new surgical technology that challenges traditional practices, and a hospital-wide crisis that tests the entire team’s cohesion. Throughout, Shaun’s autism is portrayed as both a hurdle and a unique strength, with recurring themes of empathy, teamwork, and ethical decision‑making. The series continues to explore new medical challenges and evolving interpersonal dynamics, with no definitive conclusion announced as of the latest season, leaving the audience to anticipate future developments.",
