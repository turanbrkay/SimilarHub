        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Lux, a teenager who has spent her life in foster care, being placed back into the custody of her biological parents, Cate and Baze, whom she never knew. Cate, a radio personality, and Baze, a former high school athlete, are initially unprepared for parenthood and struggle to adjust to having a teenage daughter. Lux, in turn, is wary of her parents and unsure whether she can trust them. As the series progresses, the three begin to form a bond, learning to understand and support each other. Cate and Baze grapple with their past mistakes and strive to be the parents Lux deserves, while Lux confronts the reasons for her abandonment and searches for a sense of stability. Romantic relationships develop among the characters, adding further layers of complexity to their evolving family dynamic. Throughout the series, they face challenges related to Lux’s legal status, Cate’s career, and Baze’s personal struggles, ultimately working towards a deeper understanding and acceptance of their unconventional family.",
