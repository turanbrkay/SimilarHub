        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "At the series start, Jane Doe is discovered in Times Square with a full‑body tattoo map; each mark corresponds to a crime that the FBI must solve. Agent Kurt Weller and his team use the tattoos as clues, gradually uncovering a global conspiracy involving a secret organization called The Agency. As the seasons progress, Jane’s true identity is revealed to be a former CIA operative who was planted to expose the organization’s plans. The narrative shifts from isolated cases to a larger battle against a network of corrupt officials and mercenaries, with Weller’s loyalty tested by betrayals from within his own agency. In later seasons, Jane’s past is tied to a personal vendetta against a powerful adversary, and her relationship with Weller deepens into a complex partnership. The series culminates with Jane sacrificing herself to stop a catastrophic plot, leaving Weller and the remaining team to confront the aftermath and the lingering secrets of the organization.",
