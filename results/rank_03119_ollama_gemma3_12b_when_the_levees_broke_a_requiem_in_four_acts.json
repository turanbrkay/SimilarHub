        "analytical_summary": "Spike Lee's 'When the Levees Broke' is a powerful and unflinching documentary examining the systemic failures that led to and exacerbated the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Through interviews with residents, officials, and experts, the film explores the complex interplay of poverty, racial inequality, government negligence, and inadequate infrastructure. It serves as a critical examination of disaster preparedness and response, highlighting the human cost of bureaucratic failings and the enduring impact on a community. The film’s tone is somber and investigative, prompting reflection on social responsibility and the consequences of prioritizing profit over public safety. It is a vital historical record and a poignant portrait of resilience in the face of unimaginable loss.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The documentary begins by establishing the precarious state of New Orleans' levee system prior to Hurricane Katrina, revealing warnings and concerns largely ignored by government agencies. It then follows the storm's arrival and the immediate aftermath, showcasing the widespread flooding, chaos, and desperate pleas for help from trapped residents. The film meticulously details the slow and inadequate response from local, state, and federal authorities, highlighting the breakdown of communication and the lack of coordination. Interviews with survivors paint a harrowing picture of their experiences, including the trauma of losing homes, loved ones, and a sense of security. The documentary further investigates the underlying causes of the disaster, exposing the history of racial and economic disparities that contributed to the vulnerability of New Orleans' most marginalized communities. It concludes by examining the long-term consequences of Katrina, including the displacement of residents, the destruction of neighborhoods, and the ongoing struggle for recovery and justice.",
