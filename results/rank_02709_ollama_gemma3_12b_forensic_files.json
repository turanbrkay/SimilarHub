        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Each episode of Forensic Files presents a self-contained case, beginning with the initial crime scene and the challenges faced by investigators. Forensic scientists then employ a variety of techniques – DNA analysis, ballistics, trace evidence examination, and more – to uncover clues that were initially overlooked. The series meticulously details the scientific process, explaining how evidence is collected, analyzed, and interpreted. These findings often lead to breakthroughs in the investigation, identifying suspects and ultimately contributing to their conviction or, in some cases, exonerating the wrongly accused. The series consistently demonstrates how scientific rigor and attention to detail are essential for achieving justice, often revealing surprising twists and turns in the pursuit of truth. While the specific details of each case vary, the underlying narrative arc remains consistent: a crime is committed, evidence is gathered, science provides answers, and justice is served.",
