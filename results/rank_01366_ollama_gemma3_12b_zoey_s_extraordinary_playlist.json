        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Zoey experiencing a neurological event that grants her the ability to hear people's innermost thoughts as musical numbers. Initially overwhelmed and confused, she struggles to understand and control her power, leading to awkward and humorous encounters. As she learns to interpret these 'heart songs,' Zoey begins to use her ability to connect with others on a deeper level, resolving conflicts and offering support to those around her. Throughout the series, Zoey grapples with the emotional toll of constantly hearing the unfiltered thoughts of others, particularly her strained relationship with her father, who suffers from dementia. The show explores the complexities of family dynamics, romantic relationships, and professional challenges, all while showcasing the power of music to bridge divides and foster empathy. Later seasons see Zoey confronting larger societal issues and using her ability to advocate for others, while also dealing with the evolving nature of her own relationships and the ongoing mystery surrounding the origin of her extraordinary ability. The series culminates in a poignant exploration of acceptance, forgiveness, and the enduring power of human connection.",
