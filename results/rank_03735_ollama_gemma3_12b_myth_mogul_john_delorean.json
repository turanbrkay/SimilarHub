        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins by charting John DeLorean's early career, showcasing his innovative designs and rapid ascent within General Motors. He's portrayed as a charismatic and ambitious engineer who challenged the established norms of the automotive industry. His creation of the Pontiac GTO, a muscle car that revolutionized the market, establishes him as a rising star. However, his desire for greater autonomy and financial independence leads him to leave GM and found his own company, DeLorean Motor Company. The series details the ambitious plan to create the DMC-12, a stainless steel sports car intended to be accessible to the masses. Despite initial excitement and pre-orders, the company struggles with financial difficulties and production delays. The narrative then shifts to the infamous drug trafficking allegations that engulfed DeLorean, leading to his arrest and a highly publicized trial. While he was acquitted of the primary charges, the scandal irreparably damaged his reputation and ultimately led to the collapse of his company. The documentary concludes by examining the enduring fascination with DeLorean and the ongoing debate surrounding his legacy, questioning whether he was a visionary genius or a reckless fraud.",
