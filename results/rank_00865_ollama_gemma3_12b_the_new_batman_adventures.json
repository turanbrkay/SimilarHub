        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Following the events of Batman: The Animated Series, The New Batman Adventures sees a more established Batman working alongside a team of burgeoning heroes, including Robin, Nightwing (formerly Robin), and Batgirl. The series introduces a rotating cast of guest stars from the wider DC universe, such as Supergirl, Etrigan the Demon, and The Creeper, who often require Batman's assistance or become embroiled in his investigations.
