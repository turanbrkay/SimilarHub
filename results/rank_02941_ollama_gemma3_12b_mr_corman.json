        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series centers on Josh Corman, a fifth-grade teacher in Los Angeles, who grapples with a sense of unfulfilled potential.

Throughout the series, Josh navigates the complexities of his relationships with his wife, Roxanne, a successful actress, and his parents, whose own anxieties and expectations further complicate his search for happiness. The narrative frequently shifts between Josh's present-day teaching experiences and surreal, dreamlike sequences that offer glimpses into his subconscious fears and regrets. As the series progresses, Josh confronts uncomfortable truths about himself and his family, leading to moments of both comedic absurdity and profound emotional vulnerability. While he attempts to find solace in his teaching and his marriage, the series explores the persistent feeling that something is missing, leaving Josh to question his choices and his place in the world. The narrative ultimately suggests that finding meaning isn't about achieving grand ambitions, but about accepting imperfections and appreciating the small moments of connection.",
