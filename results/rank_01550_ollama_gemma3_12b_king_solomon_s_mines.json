He is approached by a mysterious benefactor, John Roxton, who seeks Quatermain's help in finding his brother, Percy, who disappeared while searching for the legendary King Solomon's Mines. Quatermain reluctantly agrees, and they are joined by Elizabeth, Percy's fiancée, and Umbopo, a native guide. Their journey takes them deep into uncharted territory, facing numerous obstacles including hostile tribes and treacherous terrain. They discover that Percy had been captured by a ruthless warlord, Sukho, who is guarding the entrance to the mines. After a series of confrontations and escapes, the group finally reaches the mines, only to find that they are not what legend describes. The mines are a technologically advanced, ancient civilization, built by a race that vanished long ago. They uncover the truth about the mines' origins and Sukho's connection to them.
