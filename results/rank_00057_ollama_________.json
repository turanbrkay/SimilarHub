        "analytical_summary": "Scorpion follows Walter O’Brien, a self‑taught genius with a low IQ but extraordinary intellect, who assembles a team of eccentric specialists to tackle high‑tech threats that conventional agencies cannot solve. Set against the backdrop of U.S. national security, the series blends fast‑paced action with sharp humor, showcasing the team's camaraderie and inventive problem‑solving. Each episode presents a new crisis—ranging from cyber‑attacks to biological weapons—highlighting themes of teamwork, ingenuity, and the ethical limits of technology. The tone balances suspenseful drama with lighthearted banter, appealing to viewers who enjoy tech‑driven thrillers and character‑driven ensemble stories.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "In its first season, Walter O’Brien recruits a diverse group of misfits—tobey curtis, a behavioral analyst; happy quinn, a mechanical prodigy; and sylvester dodd, a statistics guru—to form the Scorpion team, which quickly becomes the nation’s last line of defense against complex, high‑tech threats. Over the next three seasons, the team tackles increasingly sophisticated challenges, from corporate espionage to bioterrorism, while also exploring personal backstories and internal tensions; key arcs include the revelation of Walter’s true origins, the team's struggle with bureaucratic obstacles, and the emergence of a shadowy antagonist manipulating global cyber‑infrastructure. The final season culminates in a high‑stakes confrontation with a global cyber‑virus that threatens to cripple worldwide systems; the Scorpion team thwarts the attack, securing their reputation, but the series concludes on a note of uncertainty as Walter and his crew face new, unseen threats beyond the screen.",
