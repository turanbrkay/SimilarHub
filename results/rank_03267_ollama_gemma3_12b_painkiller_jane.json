        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Jane, a DEA agent, infiltrating a drug cartel. During a raid, she is betrayed and left for dead, but is rescued by a mysterious organization known as the 'Aegis Institute.' They offer her a chance at survival through a controversial procedure that involves nanobots being injected into her system, granting her enhanced strength, speed, and pain tolerance. However, the procedure also leaves her with a constant need for physical pain to regulate her nanobot levels. As Jane recovers and trains, she begins to uncover a larger conspiracy involving the Aegis Institute, the cartel she was infiltrating, and a powerful pharmaceutical company. She learns that her transformation was part of a larger plan to create super-soldiers and that her past is more complicated than she initially believed. Throughout the season, Jane confronts various adversaries, including former colleagues and powerful figures within the organizations she is investigating. She struggles to control her abilities and the constant need for pain, while also seeking to expose the truth and bring those responsible for her transformation to justice.
