        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Kipo, a sheltered girl living in a utopian underground city called the Burrow. During a playful exploration, she falls through a ventilation shaft and is exposed to the surface world, teeming with mutated animals called 'mutes.' Rescued by a band of ragtag mutes, including Wolf, Ragga, and Benson, Kipo begins a perilous journey to return to the Burrow. Along the way, she discovers the complex history of the surface world, learning about the events that led to the 'Great Mutation' and the conflict between the mutes and the humans who still reside in fortified settlements. Kipo gradually learns to harness her own latent abilities, which allow her to communicate with and understand the mutes. She confronts various antagonists, including power-hungry humans seeking to exploit the mutes and ruthless mute leaders seeking to dominate the surface. Through her experiences, Kipo fosters understanding and cooperation between different groups, ultimately contributing to a fragile peace and a renewed hope for the future of the surface world. The series culminates in a confrontation that tests Kipo’s newfound abilities and her commitment to bridging the divide between humans and mutes.",
