        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Eliot Ness, a Treasury agent, arriving in Chicago with a mandate to bring down Al Capone. He assembles a small, dedicated team – Lieutenant Sean O'Brien, Officer Jimmy Malone, and Agent Chester Goule – to combat Capone’s vast network of corruption. Early episodes focus on building the team and exposing Capone’s influence over the police force and judiciary. Ness and his men face constant threats and betrayals, with Goule eventually revealed to be a double agent working for Capone. Malone, a former cop, provides crucial insights into the criminal underworld, while O'Brien struggles with his own moral compass and familial ties to the Irish mob. As the series progresses, Ness and his team systematically target Capone’s operations, disrupting his bootlegging empire and exposing his crimes. The relentless pressure eventually leads to Capone’s conviction and imprisonment, though the fight against organized crime continues with new challenges and adversaries emerging.",
