Then it returned with frequent airings in mid-February 2010, and once again got removed after its series finale on June 21, 2010. In January 2011, 6teen returned for one month only to Cartoon Network, but got removed, with other cancelled series, due to a schedule revamp. It is occasionally shown on Popgirl.\n\nThe series finale, \"Bye Bye Nikki? Part 2\", included an acoustic remake of the theme song by Brian Melo. 6teen ended with a total of 93 episodes. DVD and iTunes releases have been made in both Canada and the USA. Though ended, creators Pertsch and McGillis both extended a willingness for a possible two-hour reunion telemovie or a feature film. As of now, it is currently not on Cartoon Network's schedule, but episodes are available from Cartoon Network on Demand in select areas. On January 3, 2011, 6teen returned with reruns to Teletoon, where it airs weekend mornings at 3:00 a.m. EST, and it recently returned to its former weekday schedule at 7:00 p.m. EST.
