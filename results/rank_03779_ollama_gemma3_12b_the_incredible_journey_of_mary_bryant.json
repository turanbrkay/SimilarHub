        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Mary Bryant's conviction for theft in Cornwall and her subsequent transportation to Australia aboard the First Fleet. The voyage itself is depicted as brutal and claustrophobic, with the prisoners enduring disease, starvation, and the constant threat of violence. Upon arrival in Botany Bay, Mary faces the harsh realities of the penal colony, including backbreaking labor, inadequate resources, and the ever-present danger of escape attempts. She forms alliances with other convicts, including a resourceful Aboriginal woman named Yarran, and navigates the complex social hierarchy of the colony. As tensions escalate between the convicts and the colonial authorities, Mary becomes involved in a daring escape plan, ultimately leading her and a small group of others to freedom in the vast Australian wilderness. The series culminates in a bittersweet resolution, as Mary confronts the consequences of her actions and finds a fragile sense of belonging in a new and unfamiliar land, forever marked by her experiences.",
