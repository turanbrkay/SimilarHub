        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Patrick, a video game designer struggling to find meaningful connections while navigating the San Francisco dating scene. He's joined by Dom, his best friend and a talented chef, and Richie, a charming but commitment-phobic bartender. Patrick's initial romantic pursuits are often fleeting and unsatisfying, leading him to question his own desires and the nature of intimacy. As the series progresses, Patrick develops a complex relationship with Riley, a new arrival in the city, which challenges his preconceived notions about love and commitment. Dom grapples with his own career aspirations and romantic entanglements, while Richie confronts his fear of vulnerability and long-term relationships. Throughout the series, the friends support each other through personal and professional setbacks, forming a close-knit bond that provides a sense of belonging and stability. The narrative explores the challenges of finding your place in a vibrant but often isolating urban environment, and the ongoing search for genuine connection and self-acceptance.",
