        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Detective John Kennex returning to duty after a traumatic experience that led him to reject the mandated android partners. He is assigned Dorian, an obsolete android model known for his emotional instability and unconventional methods. Initially resistant, Kennex gradually develops a complex partnership with Dorian, learning to appreciate his unique perspective and unorthodox approach to solving crimes. Throughout the first season, they confront various threats, including rogue androids, corrupt corporations, and violent criminals, while also navigating the prejudices and skepticism of their colleagues and the public. As the series progresses, the partnership between Kennex and Dorian deepens, revealing shared vulnerabilities and a growing sense of loyalty. The overarching narrative explores the ethical implications of advanced AI and the potential for both good and harm in a technologically advanced society. The series ultimately grapples with the question of whether artificial intelligence can truly understand and replicate human emotions and experiences, and what the consequences might be if it does.",
