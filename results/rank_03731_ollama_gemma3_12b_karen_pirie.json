        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the reopening of a 25-year-old murder case in St Andrews, Scotland, initially brought to light by a popular true-crime podcast. Detective Inspector Karen Pirie, known for her direct and often abrasive approach, is assigned to review the case, which involves the death of Rosie Daly, a young bartender. As Pirie delves into the past, she uncovers inconsistencies in the original investigation and identifies potential new suspects, including a man who was initially considered a person of interest but never formally charged. The podcast's attention to the case stirs up old tensions and draws the ire of those implicated, leading to threats and escalating danger. Pirie's investigation reveals a web of secrets and lies surrounding the original crime, exposing the impact of the tragedy on the community and the families involved. As she closes in on the truth, Pirie faces resistance from those determined to keep the past buried, and the case evolves from a cold review into a present-day investigation with potentially deadly consequences. The series culminates in the exposure of the true perpetrator and the unraveling of a long-held conspiracy.",
