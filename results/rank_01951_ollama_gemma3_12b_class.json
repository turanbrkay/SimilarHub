        "analytical_summary": "Class is a British science fiction drama series serving as a spin-off of Doctor Who, focusing on the lives of students at Coal Hill School as they navigate extraordinary events and encounters with otherworldly beings. The series blends elements of teen drama with science fiction horror, exploring themes of identity, friendship, and the challenges of growing up against a backdrop of cosmic threats. It offers a darker, more grounded tone than the parent series, emphasizing psychological realism and character development while retaining the core concept of encountering the strange and dangerous.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the arrival of new students at Coal Hill School, unaware of the supernatural events that regularly plague the institution. A new teacher, Miss Quill, is revealed to be a time traveler, initially tasked with observing the students but gradually becoming involved in their lives. The students, including Charlie, Liberty, and Rowan, find themselves confronting a series of increasingly bizarre and dangerous situations, often linked to the Doctor's past adventures and the school's own mysterious history. They face threats ranging from alien creatures to shadowy organizations, uncovering secrets about their own identities and the true nature of reality. As the series progresses, the students develop their own abilities and form a close-knit group, learning to rely on each other to survive the escalating dangers. The overarching narrative explores the interconnectedness of time, space, and human experience, culminating in confrontations that challenge the students' understanding of themselves and the world around them. While the series maintains a focus on the students' personal growth, it also delves into larger themes of responsibility and the consequences of interfering with the fabric of time.",
