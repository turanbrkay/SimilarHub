        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with FBI agent Philip Kagen's wife, Samantha, vanishing without a trace. His investigation quickly leads him to a secretive government unit known as 'Hunters,' led by Corin Nielsen. These Hunters are tasked with tracking and eliminating individuals who are not entirely human – beings with extraordinary abilities and potentially malevolent intentions. As Philip delves deeper, he discovers that Samantha's disappearance is intricately linked to the Hunters' operations and that the organization itself may be more complex and morally ambiguous than he initially believed. He uncovers a history of covert actions and a network of powerful figures who are manipulating events from the shadows. Throughout the series, Philip confronts increasingly bizarre and dangerous adversaries, questioning his own sanity and the nature of reality. The Hunters' mission is revealed to be part of a larger, centuries-old conflict between humanity and these otherworldly beings, with the stakes escalating to a global scale. Philip's pursuit of the truth puts him at odds with his former allies and forces him to make difficult choices that challenge his sense of justice and loyalty.",
