        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Thony, a Syrian doctor, illegally immigrating to the United States with her son, Chris, seeking a life-saving treatment he desperately needs. When the medical system fails her, she finds herself indebted to a powerful crime syndicate. To pay off her debt and secure Chris's care, Thony accepts a job as a 'cleaner' for the organization, using her medical skills to erase evidence of their crimes. As she becomes increasingly entangled in their operations, she develops complicated relationships with various figures within the criminal underworld, including Nadia, a ruthless but occasionally sympathetic leader, and Marco, a conflicted FBI agent investigating the syndicate. Thony's double life becomes increasingly precarious as she attempts to protect her son while simultaneously evading the authorities and navigating the treacherous power dynamics of the criminal organization. Throughout the series, she uncovers deeper conspiracies and faces betrayals that force her to constantly re-evaluate her alliances and her own moral compass, all while striving to create a stable and secure future for Chris.",
