        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The first season of Genius chronicles the life of Albert Einstein, beginning with his rebellious youth in Germany and following his journey to becoming a world-renowned physicist. The season explores his struggles with authority, his passionate relationships, and the development of his theory of relativity. We see him navigate the rise of Nazism and ultimately emigrate to the United States, where he becomes a key figure in the Manhattan Project. Subsequent seasons have focused on other historical figures, such as Leonardo da Vinci, each season presenting a comprehensive look at their formative years, their significant contributions to their respective fields, and the personal challenges they faced.
