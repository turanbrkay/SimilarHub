        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The story begins with Jean Valjean's release from prison after serving nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread. Shown mercy by Bishop Myriel, Valjean breaks his parole and assumes a new identity, determined to live an honest life. However, his past continually threatens to catch up with him, particularly through the relentless pursuit of Inspector Javert, who embodies a rigid and unwavering sense of justice. Valjean finds purpose in protecting Fantine's daughter, Cosette, raising her as his own and shielding her from the harsh realities of poverty. As Cosette grows, Valjean becomes entangled in the revolutionary fervor sweeping Paris in 1832, where he encounters Marius, a young man who captures Cosette’s heart. The escalating conflict between the revolutionaries and the government forces Valjean and Javert to confront each other in a final, devastating encounter, forcing both men to question their deeply held beliefs and the very nature of justice. The revolution ultimately reshapes the lives of all involved, leaving a lasting impact on their destinies.",
