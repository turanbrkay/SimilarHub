Their lives take an unexpected turn when they become unwittingly involved in a real-life murder case. As the investigation unfolds, each character finds themselves drawn deeper into the world of true crime, with their own personal ambitions and vulnerabilities exposed. The realtor sees an opportunity to boost her career, the plumber seeks financial stability, and the tennis star hopes to recapture a sense of purpose.
