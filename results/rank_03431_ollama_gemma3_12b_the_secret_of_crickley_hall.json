        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The Caleigh family, reeling from the disappearance of their son, Gabe, a year prior, relocate to Crickley Hall in an attempt to escape their grief and start anew. Initially, the house appears to be a sanctuary, but unsettling events quickly begin to plague them.

As Eve, the mother, becomes increasingly convinced that Gabe is still present within the house, she begins to investigate its history, uncovering a dark past involving a family tragedy and a vengeful spirit.
