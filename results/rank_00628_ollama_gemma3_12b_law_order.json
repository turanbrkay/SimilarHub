        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Law & Order's format typically begins with a crime scene investigation, where detectives meticulously gather evidence and interview witnesses to identify a suspect. This initial phase often involves intense pressure to solve the case quickly, leading to difficult choices and potential compromises. Once an arrest is made, the series shifts focus to the district attorney's office, where prosecutors build a case, navigate legal challenges, and prepare for trial. The courtroom scenes depict the complexities of the legal process, including plea bargains, witness testimonies, and jury deliberations. While individual episodes often conclude with a verdict, the series as a whole explores broader themes of systemic injustice, police corruption, and the limitations of the legal system. Over its many seasons, Law & Order has tackled a vast array of social issues, reflecting the evolving landscape of crime and justice in America. The show consistently portrays the human cost of crime, both for victims and perpetrators, and the ethical dilemmas faced by those involved in the pursuit of justice.",
