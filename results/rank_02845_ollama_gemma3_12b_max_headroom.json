    "title": "Max Headroom",
    "overview": "Max Headroom is a British-produced American satirical science fiction television series by Chrysalis Visual Programming and Lakeside Productions for Lorimar-Telepictures that aired in the United States on ABC from March 1987 to May 1988. The series was based on the Channel 4 British TV pilot produced by Chrysalis, Max Headroom: 20 Minutes into the Future. The series is often mistaken as an American-produced show due to the setting and its use of an almost entirely US cast along with being broadcast in the USA on the ABC network. Cinemax aired the UK pilot followed by a six-week run of highlights from The Max Headroom Show, a music video show where Headroom appears between music videos. ABC took an interest in the pilot and asked Chrysalis/Lakeside to produce the series for US audiences.\n\nThe show went into production in late 1986 and ran for six episodes in the first season with eight being produced in season two.",

        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series is set in 1999, a future where television networks are controlled by the Great Broadcasting Corporation (GBC). Max Headroom is a computer-generated character created by Rick Gibson and Veronica Simms, initially intended as a way to monitor and satirize GBC's programming. However, Max quickly gains popularity, becoming a subversive icon who exposes the corporation's manipulative practices and the vapidness of its stars. As Max's influence grows, GBC's executives, led by the ruthless Newscorp, attempt to discredit and control him. Rick and Veronica find themselves increasingly entangled in a dangerous game of cat and mouse, struggling to protect Max and expose GBC's corruption. The series follows their efforts to maintain Max's independence while navigating the treacherous landscape of corporate media, ultimately leading to confrontations that challenge the very foundations of the broadcasting empire. The narrative arc culminates in a struggle for control of the future of entertainment and the preservation of artistic integrity in a world dominated by commercial interests.",
