    "overview": "Will Freeman lives a charmed existence as the ultimate man-child. After writing a hit song, he was granted a life of free time, free love and freedom from financial woes. He's single, unemployed and loving it. So imagine his surprise when Fiona, a needy single mom and her oddly charming 11-year-old son, Marcus, move in next door and disrupt his perfect world. When Marcus begins dropping by his home unannounced, Will's not so sure about being a kid's new best friend, until, of course, Will discovers that women find single dads irresistible. That changes everything and a deal is struck: Marcus will pretend to be Will's son and, in return, Marcus is allowed to chill at Will's house. Before he realizes it, Will starts to enjoy the visits and even finds himself looking out for the kid. In fact, this newfound friendship may very well teach him a thing or two that he never imagined possible - about himself and caring for others.",

        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Will Freeman, a man living off royalties from a song his father wrote, deliberately cultivating a carefree and detached lifestyle to avoid responsibility. His world is upended by the arrival of Fiona, a struggling single mother, and her son Marcus next door. Marcus, dealing with his mother's depression and a lack of a stable father figure, seeks out Will's company. Initially, Will sees Marcus as a means to appear more appealing to women, leading to a fabricated relationship where Marcus pretends to be his son. As their bond deepens, Will begins to experience genuine affection for Marcus and starts to confront his own emotional avoidance. Fiona, meanwhile, grapples with her own challenges, seeking stability and a sense of purpose. Throughout the series, the characters navigate complex family dynamics, romantic entanglements, and personal crises, ultimately learning to rely on each other for support and understanding. While Will begins to embrace responsibility and emotional vulnerability, Fiona strives for independence and a brighter future for herself and Marcus.
