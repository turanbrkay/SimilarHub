        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins in 1914, with a group of friends – including Frances, William, and James – navigating the early days of World War I. Initial hopes for a swift victory are quickly dashed, leading to growing disillusionment and a surge in Irish nationalism. Frances, initially sympathetic to the British cause, becomes increasingly radicalized as she witnesses the war's devastating impact and the growing injustices faced by the Irish people. William, torn between his loyalty to his family and his growing political convictions, finds himself drawn into the clandestine world of Irish republicanism. James, a complex and conflicted character, grapples with his own moral compass as he becomes entangled in the escalating tensions. As the Easter Rising approaches, the friends find themselves on opposing sides of the conflict, forced to confront their loyalties and make difficult choices that will shape the future of Ireland. The Rising itself is depicted as a chaotic and brutal struggle, with devastating consequences for all involved. The aftermath sees the survivors grappling with loss, betrayal, and the uncertain path towards Irish independence, forever marked by the events of 1916.",
