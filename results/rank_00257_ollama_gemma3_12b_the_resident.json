        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Devon Praetorius, a cynical and highly skilled senior resident, reluctantly taking on a new intern, Miles Corbett-Wallace. Miles's idealism is quickly challenged as Devon reveals the often-unpleasant truths about the hospital's operations, including financial pressures, bureaucratic red tape, and the compromises doctors must make to survive. Throughout the seasons, the doctors confront a series of complex medical cases that force them to question their own values and the ethics of their profession. Personal relationships intertwine with professional struggles, as the characters navigate romantic entanglements, family dramas, and the emotional toll of witnessing suffering. The series explores the consequences of systemic failures within the healthcare industry, highlighting the impact on both patients and medical staff. While individual cases provide immediate stakes, overarching storylines involve hospital administration conflicts, legal battles, and the constant struggle to maintain a semblance of integrity within a flawed system. The doctors face difficult choices that often blur the lines between right and wrong, leading to significant personal and professional consequences.",
