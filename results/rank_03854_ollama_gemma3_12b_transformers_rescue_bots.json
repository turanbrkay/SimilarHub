He assigns a team of younger, less experienced Transformers – Heatwave, Blades, Chase, and Boulder – to work alongside a human fire station team in the city of Jasper. The Rescue Bots learn about human culture, respond to emergencies, and gradually develop strong bonds with their human partners, Cody, Graham, and others. Throughout the series, the Rescue Bots face challenges from Decepticon remnants and other threats, learning valuable lessons about friendship, responsibility, and the importance of protecting others. While the Decepticons remain a looming threat, the focus remains on the Rescue Bots' growth and their commitment to serving their community, culminating in a deeper understanding of what it means to be a hero and a valuable member of society.",
