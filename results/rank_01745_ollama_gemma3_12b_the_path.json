        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins by introducing Eddie, a man on the cusp of becoming a Pillar—a high-ranking member of the Meyerist Movement—and his wife Sarah, a deeply committed follower. Their seemingly idyllic life is disrupted when Noah, Eddie’s troubled and skeptical brother, arrives and begins to question the movement's teachings. Noah's presence creates a rift within the family and exposes cracks in the foundation of the Meyerist beliefs. As Eddie grapples with his own doubts and Sarah fiercely defends the movement, Cal, a charismatic and ambitious leader, manipulates events to consolidate his power. The series follows the escalating tensions between the characters, revealing hidden agendas and betrayals within the movement. Eddie's journey involves a gradual unraveling of the truth about Meyerism, forcing him to confront the consequences of his choices and the potential harm inflicted upon those closest to him. The series explores the cyclical nature of faith and doubt, and the lengths to which individuals will go to protect their beliefs and their families, ultimately questioning the true meaning of devotion and the cost of blind faith.",
