        "analytical_summary": "The Haunting of Bly Manor is a gothic romance and psychological horror series that explores themes of grief, trauma, and the enduring power of memory. Set in 1980s England, the series unfolds as a young American au pair, Dani Clayton, takes a position caring for two orphaned children at the titular manor. The narrative blends elements of classic ghost stories with a focus on character development and the lingering effects of past tragedies, creating a slow-burn atmosphere of dread and melancholy. While ostensibly a horror series, the show prioritizes emotional depth and nuanced relationships over jump scares, offering a haunting and ultimately poignant exploration of love, loss, and the burdens of the past.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Dani Clayton fleeing a traumatic past in America and seeking solace in a new position as au pair to the Wingrave children, Flora and Miles, at Bly Manor. Upon arrival, she discovers the children are peculiar and withdrawn, seemingly influenced by the manor itself. As Dani settles in, she encounters the other staff members: the stoic chef Owen, the enigmatic groundskeeper Jamie, and the watchful housekeeper Mrs. Grose. Strange occurrences begin to plague the manor, including unsettling visions and the appearance of spectral figures. It becomes apparent that Bly Manor holds a dark history, with previous caretakers and residents meeting tragic ends. The narrative gradually reveals that the children are being manipulated by the spirits of the manor, particularly the vengeful ghosts of Peter Quint and Rebecca Jessel. Dani attempts to protect the children and uncover the truth behind the haunting, but she herself becomes entangled in the manor’s spectral web. The story unfolds through a series of interconnected narratives, revealing the complex relationships and tragic fates of those who have lived and died within Bly Manor’s walls. Ultimately, the series explores the idea that the manor itself is a living entity, feeding on the grief and memories of its inhabitants, and that escaping its grasp is nearly impossible.",
