        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Victor Meldrew's forced retirement, an event that throws his life into disarray. He attempts various hobbies and ventures, each ending in comical failure and escalating conflict with neighbors, businesses, and local authorities. Throughout the series, Victor's increasingly eccentric behavior and Margaret's attempts to maintain a semblance of normalcy create a constant source of tension and humor. Recurring themes involve Victor's battles with bureaucracy, his frustrations with modern technology, and his inability to adapt to a life of leisure. While the series maintains a lighthearted tone, it subtly explores deeper issues of aging, loss, and the absurdity of existence. The later seasons see Victor and Margaret facing more serious health concerns, adding a layer of poignancy to their comedic struggles, but ultimately, they remain together, navigating the challenges of life with a mixture of exasperation and affection.",
