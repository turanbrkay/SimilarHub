        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Ryan and Scott, two successful businessmen, finding their lives disrupted when their fathers, Henry and J.T., unexpectedly move in with them.

Throughout the series, the fathers' antics lead to a series of increasingly chaotic and humorous situations, testing the patience and sanity of their sons. The dynamic between the four men evolves as they attempt to understand and tolerate each other, leading to moments of genuine connection amidst the constant comedic conflict.
