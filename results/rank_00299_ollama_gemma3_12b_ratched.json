        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins in 1947, with Mildred Ratched, posing as a kind and compassionate nurse, securing a position at the Bishop Creek Sanitarium. Her true intentions are far more complex; she is secretly aiding a man, Henry Pollard, who is on the run after committing a crime. As Mildred integrates into the institution, she quickly identifies weaknesses in the system and exploits them to gain influence over the staff and patients. She manipulates Dr. John Wakefield, the institution's director, and forms alliances with other staff members, all while concealing her connection to Henry. Throughout the series, Mildred’s methods become increasingly ruthless as she orchestrates events to protect Henry and advance her own agenda. The institution itself becomes a battleground for power, with Mildred skillfully maneuvering to undermine her rivals and consolidate her control. The series culminates in a confrontation where Mildred’s true nature is fully revealed, and the consequences of her actions ripple through the lives of those around her, fundamentally altering the institution and its inhabitants.",
