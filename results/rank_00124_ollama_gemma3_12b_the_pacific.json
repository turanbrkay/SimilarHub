The story then follows Leckie’s experiences in the 1st Marine Division, detailing the relentless island hopping campaign and the constant threat of enemy attacks. As the war progresses, the series explores the psychological and emotional toll on the Marines, depicting their struggles with PTSD, grief, and the loss of innocence. The final stages of the war see the Marines involved in the battles of Okinawa, where the fighting is even more intense and the casualties are staggering.
