        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series introduces Harry Palmer, a former smuggler with a knack for observation and a disdain for authority, who is recruited by CI5, a covert intelligence agency. His initial mission involves locating a missing British scientist, Dr. Mendes, who possesses vital information about a mysterious operation known as 'Registration.' Palmer's investigation leads him through a web of deceit, uncovering a conspiracy that reaches the highest levels of government and involves both British and Soviet operatives. As he delves deeper, he discovers that the seemingly straightforward search for a missing scientist is a smokescreen for a much larger and more dangerous game. Palmer's own past and his relationship with his handler, Dalby, become increasingly complicated as he uncovers uncomfortable truths about the agency and its objectives. The series culminates in a confrontation where Palmer must choose between his loyalty to CI5 and his own sense of justice, ultimately exposing a network of corruption and challenging the established order.",
