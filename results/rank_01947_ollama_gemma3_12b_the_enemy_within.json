        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with FBI Agent Will Keaton facing a seemingly impossible situation: a deadly criminal, known only as 'The Shepherd,' is wreaking havoc, and the only person with the knowledge to stop him is Erica Shepherd, a former CIA operative who is now a convicted traitor serving a life sentence. Reluctantly, Keaton secures Shepherd's cooperation, establishing a precarious partnership where she guides him from prison. As they investigate, they uncover a deep conspiracy within the CIA, revealing Shepherd’s past actions were more complex than initially believed. The investigation forces Keaton to confront his own biases and question the integrity of the agency he serves. Throughout the series, Shepherd manipulates situations to her advantage, hinting at a larger agenda beyond simply stopping the immediate threat. The season culminates in a confrontation that exposes a network of double agents and reveals Shepherd's ultimate goal: to dismantle the very system she once served, while simultaneously seeking a form of personal redemption.",
