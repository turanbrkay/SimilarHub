The series challenges conventional narratives surrounding sexual violence and offers a nuanced portrayal of the long-term consequences for survivors and those around them.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Arabella enjoying a carefree life in London, pursuing her writing career and navigating relationships. This idyllic existence is shattered when she is sexually assaulted, and her memories of the event are hazy and incomplete. As she attempts to piece together what happened, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery, confronting her past and the impact of the assault on her relationships with her friends and boyfriend. The investigation leads her to revisit past encounters and question the nature of consent and her own behavior.
