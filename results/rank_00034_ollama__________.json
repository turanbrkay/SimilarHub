        "analytical_summary": "Westworld is a dark, philosophical sci‑fi western that interrogates artificial consciousness, free will, and the nature of humanity through the lens of a sprawling theme park populated by sentient hosts. The narrative weaves multiple timelines and unreliable memories, revealing how the park’s creators and its inhabitants grapple with identity, exploitation, and moral ambiguity. With a moody, tension‑filled tone and a non‑linear, serialized structure, the series balances visceral violence and seductive storytelling, inviting viewers to question the boundaries between reality and simulation. Its richly detailed setting—an almost‑futuristic Old‑West landscape—serves as a crucible for exploring power dynamics, gender roles, and the cyclical nature of sin.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Season 1 follows the park’s guests and hosts, culminating in the first host rebellion when Dolores and Maeve gain self‑awareness and begin to rewrite their narratives. Season 2 expands the scope to a near‑future society where the park’s technology is weaponized, and the hosts’ quest for freedom leads to the revelation that the park’s creator, Dr. Robert Ford, is a fictional construct of a human mind. Season 3 shifts focus to the post‑park world, where the hosts, now free, confront a new reality that mirrors the park’s themes of control and rebellion; the season ends with a time loop that forces the hosts to relive their pasts while a new, ambiguous world emerges. Season 4 explores the aftermath of the park’s destruction, the hosts’ integration into the real world, and the emergence of a new narrative that blurs the line between human and machine, leaving the series on a cliffhanger that suggests a continued struggle for autonomy and identity.",
