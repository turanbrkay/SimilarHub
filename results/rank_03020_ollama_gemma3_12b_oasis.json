        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Father Peter Leigh being dispatched to Oasis, a newly discovered planet designated as humanity's potential salvation from Earth's ecological collapse. The multinational corporation, Genesis Corp, is constructing a colony, promising a fresh start for a select few. However, Peter quickly discovers that the planet is far from the paradise Genesis Corp portrays. Strange occurrences plague the colony, including unexplained illnesses and unsettling environmental anomalies. As Peter investigates, he uncovers a conspiracy involving Genesis Corp's manipulation of the planet's ecosystem and the suppression of information about the dangers it poses to human life. He finds himself at odds with the corporation's leadership, who prioritize profit and control over the well-being of the colonists. The series follows Peter’s struggle to expose the truth and protect the vulnerable, while confronting his own faith and the moral compromises necessary for survival. The colonists begin to experience psychological distress and physical ailments linked to the planet’s unique properties, and Peter must race against time to uncover the root cause before the entire colony is lost.
