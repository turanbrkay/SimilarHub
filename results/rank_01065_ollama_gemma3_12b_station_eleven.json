        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins in the days leading up to the Georgia Flu pandemic, focusing on actor Arthur Leander's final performance and the lives of those connected to him, including Kirsten Raymonde, a young girl who becomes a pivotal figure in the post-apocalyptic world. As the flu rapidly spreads, decimating the global population, the narrative shifts to twenty years later, where Kirsten is part of the Traveling Symphony, a group of actors and musicians who perform Shakespeare for scattered settlements. Their journey is threatened by a mysterious Prophet, a charismatic and dangerous figure who believes the pandemic was a cleansing event and seeks to control the remaining communities. The series explores the origins of the Prophet and his connection to Arthur Leander, revealing a complex web of relationships and shared trauma. Through flashbacks, we witness the initial collapse of society and the struggles of various survivor groups, including the Children of the Corn and the Severn City Airport community. Ultimately, the series culminates in a confrontation between the Traveling Symphony and the Prophet, highlighting the importance of art, memory, and human connection in rebuilding a shattered world. The survivors grapple with the legacy of the past and strive to create a future where creativity and compassion can flourish.",
