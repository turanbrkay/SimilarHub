        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins in 1996, following the Yellowjackets, a highly competitive high school girls' soccer team, as they travel to a national tournament. A devastating plane crash leaves them stranded in the remote Canadian wilderness. Initially, the girls attempt to maintain order and signal for rescue, but as time passes and resources dwindle, they are forced to confront the harsh realities of survival. The group gradually fractures, with some embracing increasingly desperate measures to stay alive, including hunting and engaging in ritualistic practices. Flash-forwards to 2021 reveal that the survivors are haunted by their past, struggling to keep their secrets buried as a mysterious figure from the wilderness begins to resurface, threatening to expose their darkest actions. The present-day narrative follows the survivors as they grapple with the psychological scars of their ordeal, facing blackmail and the unraveling of their carefully constructed lives. The series explores the complex dynamics within the group, revealing betrayals, alliances, and the lingering impact of their time in the wilderness, ultimately hinting at a deeper, more sinister truth behind the crash and its aftermath.",
