        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Dorothy Gale, a celebrated children's book author, relocating to New York City. Initially believing her stories about Oz to be purely fictional, Dorothy soon discovers they are rooted in repressed memories of her childhood experiences. The return of the Wicked Witch of the West, manifesting in a dramatic fashion in Times Square, confirms the reality of Oz and forces Dorothy to confront her past. As Dorothy investigates the Witch's motives, she reconnects with familiar characters from Oz, now adapted to the modern world, and discovers a hidden magical community existing alongside ordinary society. The series follows Dorothy's journey as she trains to harness her own latent magical abilities, battles the Witch's increasingly powerful schemes, and ultimately confronts the Witch in a final showdown that threatens to merge the worlds of Oz and New York. Along the way, Dorothy must reconcile her public persona as a children's author with her secret life as a magical protector, and come to terms with the responsibility that comes with her unique connection to Oz.",
