        "analytical_summary": "Sex Education follows Otis Milburn, a shy British teenager whose mother is a renowned sex therapist, as he co‑creates a clandestine sex‑therapy clinic with the rebellious Maeve. The show blends sharp comedy with heartfelt drama, tackling the awkwardness of adolescence, the importance of consent, and the complexities of gender identity in a modern London grammar school. Its character‑driven narrative invites viewers to explore sexuality and mental health in an unapologetically candid way, while the setting provides a contemporary UK backdrop that grounds the social issues presented.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Season 1 introduces Otis Milburn, a socially awkward student whose mother, a licensed sex therapist, inadvertently inspires him to help his peers. Together with the rebellious Maeve, he establishes a secret sex‑therapy clinic in the school’s basement, providing candid advice on everything from contraception to emotional intimacy. The clinic’s success attracts the attention of the headteacher and the local press, forcing Otis and Maeve to navigate school politics, parental expectations, and their own burgeoning romance. By the end of the first season, their relationship reaches a fragile peak before a public scandal forces them to close the clinic temporarily. Season 2 sees the duo expand their services to include online therapy and a broader student base, while exploring subplots such as Otis’s crush on a boy named Aimee, Lily’s same‑sex relationship, and the challenges faced by LGBTQ+ students. The season also delves into Otis’s mother’s legal troubles and the eventual dissolution of the secret clinic when the school administration threatens to expose them. In Season 3, the emotional stakes rise as Otis and Maeve confront their future plans, leading to a definitive breakup but a continued friendship. The series concludes with Otis and Maeve heading to university, the underground clinic dissolving, and the characters each stepping into new chapters of their lives, underscoring themes of growth, identity, and open dialogue about sexuality.",
