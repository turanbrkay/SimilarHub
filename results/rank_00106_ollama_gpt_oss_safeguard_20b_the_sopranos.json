        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "At the series start, Tony Soprano is introduced as a respected capo who begins seeing psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi to cope with panic attacks, setting up a recurring therapeutic dynamic that exposes his vulnerabilities. Over the seasons, Tony’s leadership is challenged by internal betrayals, such as the murder of his close associate Paulie Gualtieri and the eventual death of his protégé Christopher Moltisanti, whose drug addiction and ambition create a tragic arc. The FBI’s investigation intensifies, culminating in a tense confrontation where Tony’s brother and a rival crew threaten his position.
