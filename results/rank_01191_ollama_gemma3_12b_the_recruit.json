        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Owen Hendricks, a newly minted lawyer, accepting a position at the CIA. He is quickly brought in to resolve a crisis involving Max Millie, a former CIA asset who possesses damaging information about the agency. Max claims she was wrongly accused of a crime and demands the CIA clear her name to prevent her from exposing classified information. Owen, under the guidance of Langley senior operative Violet, navigates a complex situation, attempting to exonerate Max while simultaneously preventing her from revealing secrets that could destabilize international relations. As Owen delves deeper into the case, he uncovers a conspiracy that reaches the highest levels of the CIA, realizing that Max's situation is far more complicated than initially presented. He begins to question the motives of his superiors and the true nature of his role within the agency, facing moral dilemmas and increasingly dangerous threats. The series culminates in a confrontation where Owen must choose between his loyalty to the CIA and his conscience, ultimately exposing a network of corruption and risking his own safety to uncover the truth.",
