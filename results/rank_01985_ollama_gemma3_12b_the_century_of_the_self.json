        "analytical_summary": "The Century of the Self is a documentary exploring the profound and often unsettling influence of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theories on 20th and 21st-century Western culture. It traces how Freud's ideas about the unconscious mind and the power of desire were adopted and manipulated by advertisers, politicians, and corporations to shape consumer behavior and political agendas. The film examines the rise of public relations and the deliberate construction of personality, revealing a complex interplay between psychological understanding and societal control. Ultimately, it raises questions about the nature of identity, the power of manipulation, and the potential for self-deception in a world saturated with persuasive messaging.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The documentary begins by establishing the foundational principles of Freudian psychoanalysis, emphasizing the concept of the unconscious and the role of repressed desires. It then follows the trajectory of these ideas as they are disseminated and adapted by figures like Edward Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud and a pioneer in the field of public relations. Bernays, recognizing the potential to influence public opinion, applied Freudian concepts to advertising and political campaigns, demonstrating how desires could be manufactured and exploited. The film details how these techniques were used to promote consumerism, encourage participation in World War I, and shape political narratives. It explores the rise of the 'image-obsessed' culture, where individuals are increasingly defined by their public persona and susceptible to manipulation. The documentary concludes by suggesting that the legacy of Freud continues to shape our understanding of ourselves and the world around us, albeit often in ways that are subtle and insidious.",
