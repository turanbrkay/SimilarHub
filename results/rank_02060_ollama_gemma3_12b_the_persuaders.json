To settle his debt, he's paired with Simon Brett, a sophisticated and wealthy English nobleman, by a mysterious benefactor. Each week, Danny and Simon are presented with a new case, ranging from art theft and fraud to international espionage. Their investigations often lead them across Europe, encountering a colorful cast of characters and navigating complex situations. While the cases are self-contained, a larger, overarching mystery surrounding their benefactor and the true nature of their partnership slowly unfolds, hinting at a deeper conspiracy.
