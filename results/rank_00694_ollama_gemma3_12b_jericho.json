However, the arrival of strangers and the discovery of a mysterious radio signal complicate matters, revealing that not everyone shares their desire for peace. As the weeks turn into months, the town faces threats from outside groups vying for control of resources and struggling with internal divisions over how to handle the crisis. Jake Green, a former Marine, emerges as a key figure, attempting to maintain order and protect his community. The search for answers about the attacks and the fate of loved ones drives many characters, leading them on perilous journeys.
