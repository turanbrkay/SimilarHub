        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Walter Sherman, a man haunted by his past experiences in Iraq, using his extraordinary ability to find lost items and people. He operates out of a houseboat in Seattle, often assisted by Willmore Kirk, a former FBI agent, and Inspector Galen, a local police officer. Walter's past is gradually revealed through flashbacks, showcasing the events that led to his unique ability and the trauma he carries. Throughout the series, Walter takes on increasingly complex cases, often involving missing persons, stolen artifacts, and uncovering hidden secrets. He frequently clashes with criminals and confronts his own demons, seeking redemption for past mistakes. As the series progresses, Walter's relationships with Willmore and Galen deepen, forming a found-family dynamic that provides him with support and understanding. The overarching narrative explores Walter's journey towards healing and finding purpose in helping others, while also delving into the personal struggles of those around him. While the series was cancelled prematurely, the final episodes hinted at Walter facing a significant threat related to his past, suggesting a potential resolution that never materialized.",
