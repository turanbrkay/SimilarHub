        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series centers on three main characters: Emily, a glamorous and seemingly perfect suburban mother; Megan, a young photographer with a troubled past; and Broome, a detective investigating a cold case. The narrative begins with the disappearance of Carlton Flynn, a man whose death seventeen years prior remains shrouded in mystery. Shortly after, the disappearance of another man triggers a chain of events that forces Emily, Megan, and Broome to confront their own buried secrets and the connections they share with the deceased. Emily's carefully constructed life begins to unravel as she is forced to confront her involvement in Carlton's death, while Megan's past as a witness to a violent crime resurfaces, threatening to expose her. Detective Broome, haunted by his past failures, relentlessly pursues the truth, uncovering a web of lies and betrayals that implicate everyone involved. The investigation reveals a complex history of violence, manipulation, and long-held grudges, ultimately leading to a confrontation that exposes the devastating consequences of past actions and the enduring power of secrets. The series culminates in a resolution that brings a degree of closure, but leaves the characters forever marked by the events they have endured.",
