    "overview": "Through globalization, many countries have been opened and barriers removed to ensure easy trade, travel and cultural diversity. However, this openness has given opportunities to criminals looking to exploit the system and ultimately threaten our global safety. As Europe has become a \"safe house\" for criminals eluding law enforcers, a special kind of law enforcement team is needed to handle specific ongoing crimes on a global level. \"Crossing Lines\" is the story of one such team, made up of five international cops, headed by Captain Daniel. The team - comprised of individuals who have little in common - must learn to live and work under the most dangerous and potentially deadly conditions. Housed in an unused storage section underneath the ICC, this mismatched team faces bureaucratic, jurisdictional and cultural obstacles while traversing continents in pursuit of justice.",

        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the formation of a specialized team under Captain Daniel, assembled to address crimes that fall outside the jurisdiction of individual nations. Each member brings a unique skillset and personal history, creating immediate friction and requiring them to learn to work together. Early cases involve human trafficking, cybercrime, and terrorism, showcasing the breadth of threats facing the global community. As the team investigates, they encounter bureaucratic red tape, political interference, and the moral compromises necessary to achieve their goals. Relationships between team members evolve, with alliances forming and betrayals surfacing as they confront increasingly dangerous adversaries. The series explores the toll that constant exposure to violence and injustice takes on the officers, forcing them to question their own values and the effectiveness of their methods. While the team achieves some successes in bringing criminals to justice, they also face setbacks and losses, highlighting the complexities of international law enforcement and the enduring nature of global crime.",
