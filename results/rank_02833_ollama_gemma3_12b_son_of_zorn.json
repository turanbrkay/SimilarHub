        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Zorn, a seasoned warrior from the land of Zeebodia, arriving in Orange County after years of separation from his family. He's determined to win back his ex-wife, Edie, and forge a relationship with his teenage son, Alan, who is struggling to understand his father's fantastical nature. Zorn's attempts to integrate into suburban life are consistently chaotic, often involving his animated powers and Zeebodian customs clashing with the mundane realities of school, soccer practice, and PTA meetings. Throughout the series, Zorn faces numerous obstacles, including Edie's skepticism, Alan's embarrassment, and the general bewilderment of their neighbors. He also encounters various Zeebodian figures who complicate his attempts at reconciliation. While Zorn strives to be a good father and husband, his methods are often unconventional and lead to humorous misunderstandings and escalating situations. The series explores the complexities of family, identity, and belonging, ultimately portraying Zorn's journey to find his place in a world that is both familiar and utterly foreign.",
