        "analytical_summary": "Late Night with David Letterman revolutionized the late-night talk show format, eschewing traditional interviews for absurdist comedy, ironic detachment, and a playful deconstruction of television conventions. The show's influence can be seen in subsequent late-night programs, establishing a precedent for a more self-aware and unconventional approach to entertainment. It blended comedic monologues, musical performances, and recurring segments, creating a unique and often unpredictable viewing experience. The show's success stemmed from Letterman's willingness to challenge expectations and embrace a more irreverent style of humor.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The show's initial run established a unique comedic landscape, characterized by Letterman's sardonic wit and willingness to mock the very structure of a talk show. Recurring segments like 'Stupid Pet Tricks,' 'Top Ten Lists,' and the often-chaotic 'Viewer Mail' became hallmarks of the show's identity. As the show progressed, Letterman's relationship with NBC became increasingly strained, culminating in a contract dispute and his eventual departure for CBS. This transition marked the end of the original Late Night era, paving the way for Conan O'Brien to take over the time slot and continue the franchise with his own distinct comedic style. The show's legacy lies in its pioneering approach to late-night television and its lasting impact on the genre.",
