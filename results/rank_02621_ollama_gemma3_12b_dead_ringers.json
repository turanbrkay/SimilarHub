The series delves into themes of ambition, identity, and the blurring lines between reality and delusion, set against a backdrop of 1990s New York City. With a darkly comic tone and a focus on the sisters' increasingly fraught dynamic, the show offers a suspenseful and unsettling exploration of female ambition and the price of pushing boundaries.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Elliot and Beverly, both brilliant but frustrated surgical residents, struggling against the sexism and limitations imposed on women in the medical field. They hatch a plan to open a private clinic, offering innovative and often ethically questionable treatments, particularly focused on reproductive health. As their clinic gains notoriety and attracts a diverse clientele, the twins' bond intensifies, but so does their competition and paranoia. Beverly, increasingly reliant on drugs and prone to erratic behavior, begins to question Elliot's motives and the true nature of their shared identity. The lines between their lives become increasingly blurred, leading to a descent into psychological turmoil and a dangerous game of manipulation and deception. The sisters' shared ambition ultimately leads to a confrontation that threatens to unravel their carefully constructed reality and expose the dark secrets at the heart of their relationship, culminating in a tragic and ambiguous ending that leaves the audience questioning the true nature of their shared fate.",
