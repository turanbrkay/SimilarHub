        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the Russo siblings, Alex, Justin, and Max, living above their parents' sandwich shop in New York City. They are unaware that their parents are wizards and that they, too, are destined to inherit magical abilities. When the children discover their magical heritage, they begin training under their father, Jerry, in preparation for the 'Wizard Competition,' a contest to determine who will become the family wizard and retain their powers, while the others lose theirs. Throughout the series, the siblings navigate typical teenage experiences – school, friendships, crushes – while simultaneously struggling to master spells and avoid exposing their secret to the world. Alex, the rebellious and often mischievous sibling, frequently clashes with Justin, the studious and responsible one, while Max, the youngest, often provides comic relief. As the series progresses, the siblings face various magical challenges and adversaries, learning valuable lessons about teamwork, responsibility, and the importance of family. The series culminates in the Wizard Competition, where the siblings must confront their individual flaws and ultimately demonstrate their growth as wizards and as a family. The competition results in a bittersweet resolution, with one sibling ultimately becoming the family wizard, while the others must relinquish their powers, though their bond remains strong.",
