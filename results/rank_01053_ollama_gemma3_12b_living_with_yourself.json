        "analytical_summary": "Living with Yourself is a darkly comedic drama that explores themes of identity, self-improvement, and the pursuit of happiness. The series follows Miles, a man struggling with burnout who undergoes an experimental treatment intended to alleviate his stress. However, the procedure results in the creation of a 'better' version of himself, leading to complex and often humorous consequences as the two Miles navigate their shared life and relationships. The show blends elements of science fiction with a grounded exploration of human flaws and the desire for a more fulfilling existence, offering a satirical commentary on modern anxieties and the search for self-optimization.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Miles and his wife, Kate, experiencing a period of significant stress and dissatisfaction in their lives. Seeking a solution, Miles undergoes a revolutionary treatment at a mysterious spa, intended to alleviate his anxieties and improve his overall well-being. Upon waking, he discovers that he has been replaced by a near-perfect replica of himself – a version who is more confident, successful, and emotionally stable. Initially, the new Miles seems to be a welcome improvement, effortlessly resolving conflicts and achieving goals that were previously unattainable. However, as the two Miles coexist, tensions arise, and the complexities of their shared identity become increasingly apparent. Kate, initially charmed by the 'improved' Miles, begins to question the authenticity of their connection and the true nature of the replacement. The series delves into the ethical implications of the procedure, exploring the potential for abuse and the inherent dangers of attempting to engineer a 'better' human being. The original Miles struggles to reclaim his life and identity, while the replacement grapples with the burden of living a life that isn't entirely his own. The narrative culminates in a confrontation between the two Miles, forcing them to confront the fundamental questions of what it means to be human and the value of imperfection.",
