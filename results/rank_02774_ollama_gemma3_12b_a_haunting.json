        "analytical_summary": "A Haunting is a documentary series presenting purportedly true accounts of paranormal experiences. Each episode features a first-person narrative of individuals who believe they are haunted, exploring the emotional and psychological impact of these events. The series blends elements of mystery and horror, aiming to create a suspenseful atmosphere while examining the intersection of personal tragedy and the supernatural. While presented as factual, the series' impact relies heavily on the emotional resonance of the stories and the ambiguity surrounding the nature of the hauntings. It explores themes of grief, loss, and the enduring power of traumatic events.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Each episode of A Haunting centers around a different family or individual who claims to be experiencing paranormal activity. The narratives typically begin with a tragic event – a death, a suicide, or a violent crime – that leaves a psychic imprint on a location. Years later, new residents or family members unknowingly move into the affected property and begin to experience unsettling phenomena, ranging from unexplained noises and apparitions to feelings of dread and psychological distress. The stories often involve investigations into the history of the property, uncovering details about the original tragedy and the individuals involved. While the series presents these accounts as factual, the underlying narrative arc follows a familiar pattern: initial skepticism, escalating paranormal activity, and a sense of helplessness in the face of the supernatural. The series does not offer definitive explanations for the hauntings, leaving the audience to ponder the nature of the paranormal and the enduring power of loss.",
