Through interviews and archival footage, the series explores Anthony Templet's upbringing, his relationship with his father, and the events leading up to the shooting. It aims to understand, rather than judge, the motivations behind a deeply disturbing act, raising questions about family dynamics, mental health, and the nature of violence. The series adopts a largely observational tone, allowing viewers to grapple with the unsettling subject matter and draw their own conclusions. It's a challenging and thought-provoking exploration of a tragic event.",
