Initially, Darwin possesses the ability to speak, a secret carefully guarded by the family to protect him from exploitation. Throughout their travels, the Thornberrys encounter various challenges, from navigating dangerous terrains to mediating conflicts between different animal species. Debbie, the teenage daughter, often struggles with the unconventional lifestyle and yearns for a more 'normal' existence, while Donnie, the younger brother, provides comic relief with his quirky observations.
