    "overview": "When Dave and Vicky were growing up, their parents had it easy. Back then, there were no “time-outs,” no one had any “boundaries,” and “parenting” wasn’t even a word. Parents had no idea what their kids were really up to and ignorance truly was bliss. Now Dave and Vicky have teenagers of their own, and anything their kids might even think about doing, Dave and Vicky have already done… at least twice. But knowledge isn’t power – it’s a giant pain! Every day is a battle to keep the kids in line. Dave and Vicky figure if they can send these three off to college without a police record or kids of their own, they’ve done their job.",

The series humorously explores the challenges of parenting in a modern era where children often surpass their parents' experiences. It blends observational comedy with exaggerated scenarios, offering a lighthearted look at the struggles of maintaining authority and understanding the next generation.

        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series revolves around Dave and Vicky, a couple who, as teenagers, lived a relatively carefree existence, free from parental oversight. Now, as parents of three, they find themselves confronting the consequences of their past actions as their own children push boundaries and challenge authority.

Throughout the series, Dave and Vicky grapple with the realization that their past experiences have inadvertently shaped their children's choices, leading to humorous clashes and misunderstandings.
