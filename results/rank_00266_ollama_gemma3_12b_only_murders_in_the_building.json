        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the sudden death of Tim Kono, a resident of the luxurious Arconia apartment building. Three unlikely friends – Charles-Haden Savage, a washed-up actor; Oliver Putnam, a struggling Broadway director; and Mabel Mora, a young artist – discover they share a passion for true crime podcasts. Following a series of cryptic clues left by Tim, they decide to launch their own podcast to investigate his death, believing it to be a murder. Their initial investigation reveals a web of secrets and suspicious characters within the building, including Tim’s estranged wife, his business partner, and several other residents with hidden agendas. As they dig deeper, the trio becomes increasingly entangled in the mystery, facing danger and suspicion themselves. A second murder occurs, further complicating the investigation and raising the stakes. The first season culminates in the revelation of the killer's identity and their motive, which is tied to a long-standing feud and a hidden treasure. The subsequent seasons continue the pattern, with new murders and new suspects emerging, forcing the trio to confront their own flaws and vulnerabilities while unraveling increasingly complex mysteries within the Arconia.",
