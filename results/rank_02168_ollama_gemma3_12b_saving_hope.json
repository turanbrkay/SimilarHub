        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the sudden and unexplained coma of Dr. Charlie Harris, leaving his fiancée, Dr. Alex Reid, and the entire staff of Hope-Zion Hospital reeling. As the hospital struggles to cope with the loss of a key surgeon, Charlie begins to manifest as a disembodied presence, able to observe the hospital and its staff but unable to directly interact with them. Initially unsure if he is a ghost or a product of his own subconscious, Charlie attempts to understand his condition and offer guidance to his colleagues, particularly Alex, who is struggling to maintain the hospital's operations and her own emotional well-being. Throughout the series, the medical team faces a constant stream of challenging cases, often intertwined with Charlie’s spectral interventions. As the seasons progress, the mystery surrounding Charlie’s coma deepens, revealing connections to his past and hinting at a larger, unexplained phenomenon. While the series explores the possibility of Charlie regaining his physical form, the focus remains on the resilience of the hospital staff and their ability to find hope amidst tragedy and uncertainty. The series concludes with a sense of closure for the main characters, acknowledging the profound impact of Charlie’s presence and the enduring strength of the Hope-Zion community.",
