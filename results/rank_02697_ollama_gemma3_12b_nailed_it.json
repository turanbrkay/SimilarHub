They are presented with a complex dessert creation, often a multi-layered cake or intricate pastry, and tasked with replicating it as closely as possible. The contestants' attempts are frequently fraught with mishaps, resulting in comical and visually striking failures. Throughout the episode, Jacques Torres, a professional pastry chef, provides commentary and guidance, often highlighting the contestants' errors and offering suggestions for improvement. At the end of each episode, the contestants' creations are judged based on their resemblance to the original dessert.
