        "analytical_summary": "Suits follows the unlikely partnership between a brilliant, drug‑running college dropout with a photographic memory and a top New York City closers, as they navigate the high‑stakes world of corporate law while keeping the former’s secret identity hidden. The series balances sharp, witty dialogue with tense courtroom drama, exploring themes of deception, loyalty, ambition, and the mentor‑mentee dynamic.

The tone remains fast‑paced and character‑driven, blending humor with the intensity of legal battles.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Mike Ross, a brilliant college dropout with a photographic memory, fakes a law degree and lands a job at the prestigious Pearson Specter firm, where he works under senior partner Harvey Specter. Their secret partnership becomes the central tension as Mike’s unlicensed status threatens to expose the firm, while he and Harvey tackle high‑profile corporate cases, client negotiations, and internal power struggles involving partners Louis Litt, Donna Paulsen, and Jessica Pearson. Throughout the series, Mike’s past as a drug dealer and his relationships with clients such as Jessica’s former associate, Rachel Zane, and the firm’s board members create multiple subplots. Louis’s rivalry with Harvey over firm leadership, Donna’s role as confidante and eventual partner, and Jessica’s ascent to managing partner all intertwine with the firm’s expansion and rebranding efforts. By season 4, Mike’s secret is discovered, leading to a temporary partnership dissolution and a series of legal and personal repercussions. In season 5, Mike is forced to leave the firm and becomes a judge, but later returns to Pearson Specter Litt after a time‑skip, where he and Harvey form a new firm, Specter Ross, in the final episode. The series concludes with a flashforward showing the duo running their own firm, having achieved personal and professional redemption while maintaining their complex bond.",
