        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Bruce, a successful but somewhat socially awkward accountant from New York, falling for Emma, a Swedish woman he meets on a business trip. Driven by his affection for her, Bruce impulsively decides to move to Sweden, leaving behind his established life in the United States. Upon arrival, he encounters a vastly different culture, characterized by a more reserved and egalitarian social structure. Bruce's attempts to assimilate often lead to comedic misunderstandings and awkward situations, as he struggles to grasp Swedish customs and social cues. He integrates into Emma’s family, a quirky and eccentric group, and attempts to find work, facing challenges and humorous setbacks along the way. Throughout the series, Bruce’s journey involves learning to appreciate the nuances of Swedish culture, building relationships with his new community, and navigating the complexities of a long-distance relationship that has now become a cross-cultural one. While he experiences moments of frustration and cultural disorientation, Bruce ultimately finds a sense of belonging and personal growth in his new home.",
