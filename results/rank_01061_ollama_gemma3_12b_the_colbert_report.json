    "title": "The Colbert Report",
    "overview": "The Colbert Report is an American satirical late night television program that airs Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central. It stars political humorist Stephen Colbert, a former correspondent for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. The Colbert Report is a spin-off from and counterpart to The Daily Show that comments on politics and the media in a similar way. It satirizes conservative personality-driven political pundit programs, particularly Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor. The show focuses on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a \"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot\", is a caricature of televised political pundits.\n\nThe Colbert Report has been nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards each in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, two Television Critics Association Awards Awards, and two Satellite Awards. In 2013, it won two Emmys. It has been presented as non-satirical journalism in several instances, including by the Tom DeLay Legal Defense Trust and by Robert Wexler following his interview on the program. The Report received considerable media coverage following its debut on October 17, 2005, for Colbert's coining of the term \"truthiness\", which dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster named its 2006 Word of the Year.",

        "analytical_summary": "The Colbert Report was a groundbreaking satirical news program that parodied the style and conventions of conservative political commentary. Hosted by Stephen Colbert, the show employed a fictional persona – a caricature of a well-intentioned but uninformed political pundit – to critique media and politics. The program's unique blend of scripted segments, improvisational humor, and celebrity interviews created a distinctive and influential format. Its impact extended beyond entertainment, occasionally blurring the lines between satire and genuine news coverage, and introducing concepts like 'truthiness' into the cultural lexicon. The Colbert Report ultimately redefined the possibilities of late-night television and political satire.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The Colbert Report didn's have a traditional narrative arc. Instead, each episode revolved around Stephen Colbert, in character, commenting on current events and political figures. The show's structure involved a 'report' segment where Colbert presented a satirical news story, followed by interviews with guests, often politicians or celebrities. A recurring element was Colbert's interactions with the audience and his 'correspondent' band, The Late Show Players. Throughout its run, the show consistently pushed the boundaries of political satire, often engaging in playful antagonism with conservative figures and challenging conventional media practices. The show concluded in December 2014, after a decade of commentary, leaving behind a legacy of innovative and impactful political humor.",
