        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The Mentalist follows Patrick Jane, a former psychic who uses his exceptional observation skills to solve crimes for the California Bureau of Investigation. Jane’s cynical, anti-hero detective persona is driven by a personal obsession with justice and a long-running vendetta against the serial killer Red John, whose identity remains a mystery for most of the series. Over seven seasons, Jane’s investigations of serial killers, combined with his use of psychic-illusion and keen observation, create a suspenseful, dark procedural that balances episodic casework with a serialized arc. In the final season, Jane confronts and ultimately kills Red John, bringing closure to his personal quest, while Lisbon remains at the bureau and Jane departs to start a new chapter in his life.",
