        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Patty Hewes, a renowned but ethically questionable lawyer, hiring recent law school graduate Ellen Parsons as her protégé. The first season focuses on a complex case involving a wealthy businessman accused of murder, revealing Patty's manipulative tactics and Ellen's gradual disillusionment. As Ellen becomes increasingly involved in Patty’s schemes, she uncovers a deeper conspiracy linked to Patty’s past and her own family. The second season introduces a new case and further explores the intricate web of relationships within Hewes & Associates, culminating in a shocking revelation about Ellen’s connection to the central conflict. Subsequent seasons shift the focus to Patty and Ellen's fractured relationship, as Ellen begins to forge her own path and confront the consequences of her involvement with Hewes & Associates.
