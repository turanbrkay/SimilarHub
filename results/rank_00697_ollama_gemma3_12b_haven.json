        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "FBI agent Audrey Parker is sent to Haven, Maine, to investigate a murder, but quickly discovers the town is plagued by 'Troubles' – individuals with unique and often dangerous supernatural abilities. She encounters Nathan Wuornos, a local man who has been confined to his home for years due to his ability to absorb Troubles' powers. As Audrey investigates the Troubles and their connection to the murder, she begins to experience fragmented memories of her own past, realizing she has a deeper connection to Haven than she initially suspected. Throughout the series, Audrey and Nathan work together to contain the Troubles and uncover the truth behind their origins, facing opposition from a shadowy organization seeking to exploit the Troubles for their own purposes. The series explores the cyclical nature of the Troubles, revealing that they are not a recent phenomenon but have plagued Haven for generations. Audrey's own identity is gradually revealed to be tied to the Troubles, and she must confront her past and embrace her role in the town's fate. The series culminates in a confrontation with the source of the Troubles, forcing Audrey and the residents of Haven to make difficult choices that will determine the town's future and the nature of the supernatural forces at play.",
