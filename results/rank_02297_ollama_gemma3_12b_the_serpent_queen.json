        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with a much older Catherine de Medici recounting her life story to a young woman, framing the narrative as a cautionary tale. As a young woman, Catherine arrives in France as a pawn in a political alliance, orphaned and initially dismissed as insignificant. She quickly discovers that her husband, King Henry II, is infatuated with Diane de Poitiers, leaving Catherine marginalized and unable to produce an heir. Facing political isolation and personal disappointment, Catherine begins to learn the rules of the court, employing cunning and manipulation to secure her position. Following Henry’s death, Catherine’s sons, Francis II and Charles IX, ascend to the throne, each presenting new challenges and requiring Catherine to navigate complex power struggles. She orchestrates alliances, manipulates rivals, and ultimately secures her family's claim to the throne, becoming a powerful and influential figure in French history. The series culminates with Catherine’s continued reign, demonstrating her mastery of the political game and solidifying her legacy as a formidable queen.",
