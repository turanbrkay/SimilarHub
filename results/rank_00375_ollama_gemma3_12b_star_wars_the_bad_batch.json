        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins immediately following Order 66, with Clone Force 217, nicknamed the 'Bad Batch' due to their mutations, being deployed on various missions. Hunter, Echo, Wrecker, Tech, and Crosshair, each possessing unique abilities, initially serve the newly formed Galactic Empire. However, as they witness the Empire's increasingly oppressive tactics and the betrayal of their former allies, their loyalty is tested. Crosshair, deemed a liability due to his independent thinking, is separated from the squad and becomes a dedicated Imperial enforcer. The remaining Bad Batch, led by Hunter, goes rogue, seeking to carve out a life for themselves and protect those caught in the Empire's crosshairs. They encounter various individuals and groups, including a youngling named Omega, who becomes an integral part of their found family. Throughout their journey, they face constant pursuit by the Empire, navigate complex political landscapes, and confront the consequences of their past actions, ultimately questioning their role in a galaxy consumed by conflict. The series explores the long-term impact of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire on individuals and the galaxy at large, with the Bad Batch struggling to find a place in a world that no longer needs them.",
