        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Somen Banerjee, an Indian immigrant struggling to find his place in Los Angeles. He initially opens a small, struggling dance studio, but recognizing the potential for a more lucrative venture, he conceives of a male-stripping troupe, the Chippendales. Banerjee, rebranding himself as Steve, meticulously crafts the troupe's image and choreography, aiming for a level of sophistication and artistry that sets them apart. As the Chippendales gain popularity and become a cultural sensation, Steve’s ambition spirals into obsession and paranoia. He implements increasingly restrictive and controlling measures to maintain his grip on the business, leading to internal conflicts and resentment among the dancers. A former dancer, Nick O’Brien, becomes a significant threat, leading to a series of escalating events involving blackmail, arson, and ultimately, a deadly confrontation. Steve’s relentless pursuit of control and his willingness to cross moral and legal boundaries ultimately lead to his downfall, leaving a legacy of both entertainment and tragedy.",
