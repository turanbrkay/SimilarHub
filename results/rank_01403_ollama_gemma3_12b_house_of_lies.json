        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Marty Kaan, a highly skilled but ethically flexible management consultant, attempting to secure a lucrative contract with the powerful Wexler Group. He and his team – Izzy, Miles, Tanner, and Monica – employ manipulative tactics and exploit personal relationships to win over CEO Henry Grabinski. As the series progresses, the team faces increasing pressure to deliver results, leading to escalating conflicts with Grabinski and internal power struggles within the group. Relationships are tested as personal lives intertwine with professional ambitions, and past actions come back to haunt the consultants. The team's pursuit of wealth and influence leads them down increasingly questionable paths, forcing them to confront the consequences of their choices and the moral compromises they're willing to make. Over time, the team members experience personal growth and face challenges that force them to re-evaluate their values and their place in the corporate landscape, though their core manipulative tendencies remain.",
