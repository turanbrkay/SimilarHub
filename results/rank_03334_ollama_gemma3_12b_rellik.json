        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Detective Inspector Gabriel Markham seemingly on the verge of collapse, having just witnessed a devastating event. As the narrative unfolds in reverse, we see Markham's investigation into a series of murders gradually reveal the killer's identity and the events that led to the crimes.
