        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series chronicles the legal battle surrounding Billy Milligan, a young man accused of committing a series of crimes in the 1970s. Milligan's defense hinged on the claim that he suffered from multiple personality disorder (now known as dissociative identity disorder), with 24 distinct personalities allegedly controlling his actions. The series follows the court proceedings, where expert witnesses presented conflicting opinions on Milligan's mental state. The trial captivated the nation, with the public largely sympathetic to Milligan's plight. Despite the initial verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, Milligan's subsequent actions and the revelations about the validity of his claims led to a reevaluation of his case and a transfer to a state hospital. The series explores the impact of the case on Milligan's family, the legal professionals involved, and the broader understanding of mental illness within the criminal justice system, ultimately questioning the reliability of diagnoses and the complexities of accountability.",
