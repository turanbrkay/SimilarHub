The show blends historical fantasy with contemporary humor, exploring themes of cultural displacement and finding belonging.

        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Tutankhamen, a young pharaoh, accidentally being mummified and entombed. Thousands of years later, he is unearthed by a construction crew in modern-day America, specifically in the town of Fishburg. He is taken in by the O’Hara family, who attempt to keep his existence a secret while he learns to navigate the complexities of contemporary life. Throughout the series, Tut struggles to understand modern customs and technology, often leading to humorous misunderstandings and chaotic situations. He also faces challenges from those who seek to exploit his ancient powers or return him to his tomb. Recurring antagonists include the nefarious Baron Von Hess, who desires to harness Tut’s abilities for his own gain, and various historical figures brought to life through magical means. As the series progresses, Tut develops strong bonds with the O’Hara family and his friends, learning valuable lessons about friendship, responsibility, and the importance of embracing change. While he occasionally longs for his past, he ultimately finds a sense of belonging and purpose in his new life, embracing his role as a modern-day mummy.",
