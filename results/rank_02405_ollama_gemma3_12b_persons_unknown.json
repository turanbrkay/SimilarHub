        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with a diverse group of individuals – a former con man, a grieving mother, a troubled teenager, a disillusioned doctor, and others – each receiving a cryptic invitation to Sitka, Alaska. Upon arrival, they discover they are not alone; a larger group has already gathered, all drawn by an unknown force. As they attempt to understand why they were summoned, they begin to experience fragmented memories and unsettling visions, suggesting a shared, traumatic past.
