        "analytical_summary": "Anne with an E follows the spirited orphan Anne Shirley as she navigates life in rural Ontario during the late 1890s, challenging gender expectations and fighting for acceptance. The series balances heartwarming moments with the harsh realities of bullying, poverty, and social injustice, all while celebrating imagination and resilience. Through her relationships with the Green family, friends, and teachers, Anne transforms her community and learns to define her own identity. The tone is nostalgic, inspirational, and occasionally bittersweet, capturing the complexities of growing up in a restrictive society.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Season one opens with Anne mistakenly sent to live with Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert at Green Gables, where her imaginative storytelling and outspoken nature quickly clash with the town's expectations. Over the course of the season, Anne confronts bullying at school, forms close friendships with Diana and Gilbert, and helps Marilla publish a book of her letters, while also dealing with her own feelings for the farm's blacksmith, Matthew. Season two follows Anne as she navigates adolescence, including a romantic interest in a new teacher, a rivalry with a socialite, and a growing sense of activism against local injustices such as the treatment of indigenous peoples. The third season culminates in Anne's departure from Green Gables to pursue further education and a career as a teacher, leaving her mark on the town and solidifying her role as a catalyst for change.",
