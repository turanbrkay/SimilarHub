        "analytical_summary": "Fear the Walking Dead follows a diverse family and a group of strangers in Los Angeles as the world descends into a zombie apocalypse. The series blends gritty survival drama with complex character dynamics, exploring how ordinary people confront moral ambiguity and loss while clinging to hope. Its tense, realistic tone is underscored by relentless danger and the collapse of societal structures. The narrative tracks the evolution of a fractured family unit and the broader human struggle to rebuild amid chaos.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series opens with the Reyes family—Maya, her husband Daniel, and their children—trying to escape the outbreak in Los Angeles. As the city falls into anarchy, they encounter a group of survivors led by former police officer Nick and his wife Alicia, who join forces to protect the children. Over multiple seasons, the group faces betrayals, internal conflict, and the loss of key members such as Daniel, Nick, and Alicia, while Maya and her children grapple with the responsibilities of leadership and the erosion of trust. The narrative follows their journey through various safe zones, including a high-rise apartment and a warehouse, as they confront both the undead and human threats. By the series' conclusion, the remaining characters confront a new threat from a hostile survivor group, and the final episodes focus on the moral choices of survival and the uncertain future of the post-apocalyptic world, with the series ending on a cliffhanger that leaves the ultimate fate of the characters unresolved.",
