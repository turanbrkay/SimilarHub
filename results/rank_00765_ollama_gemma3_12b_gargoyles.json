        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the awakening of the Gargoyle clan, led by Goliath, in 1994 New York City, after being magically transported from 10th-century Scotland. They are employed by David Xanatos, a wealthy businessman, to serve as security for his new skyscraper. Initially, the gargoyles struggle to understand and adapt to modern society, facing prejudice and misunderstanding from humans. They form an uneasy alliance with a police detective, Elisa Maza, who becomes their primary human contact and advocate. As they investigate threats to New York, they uncover a larger conspiracy involving their former allies, the Wyvern Clan, who have embraced a path of darkness and vengeance. The gargoyles confront their past mistakes and grapple with the complexities of morality, ultimately striving to protect the city and find a place for themselves within it. Throughout the series, they encounter various magical creatures and historical figures, further complicating their quest for acceptance and justice, and facing betrayals and losses that test their bonds of loyalty.",
