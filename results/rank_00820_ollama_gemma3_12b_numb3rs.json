        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Don Eppes, an FBI agent, recognizing his brother Charlie's extraordinary mathematical abilities and recruiting him to assist in solving crimes. Charlie, a university lecturer, initially resists, preferring the academic world. However, he gradually becomes an integral part of the team, using his skills in pattern recognition, probability, and statistics to predict criminal behavior and identify suspects. Throughout the series, the brothers navigate complex cases ranging from bank robberies and serial killings to terrorism and organized crime. Their relationship is tested by differing approaches to problem-solving and personal conflicts. As the series progresses, Charlie's mathematical abilities become more crucial to solving increasingly dangerous and intricate cases, often involving significant personal risk. The brothers face challenges from within the FBI, as some agents are skeptical of Charlie's methods. Recurring antagonists and complex criminal networks emerge, creating long-term threats that require the brothers to work together and push the boundaries of their abilities. While the brothers achieve successes in solving crimes, they also confront the emotional toll of their work and the sacrifices they must make.",
