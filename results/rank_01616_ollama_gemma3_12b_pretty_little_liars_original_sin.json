        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins twenty years after a devastating accident nearly destroyed Millwood, a town struggling with economic hardship and a history of secrets. Five teenage girls – Imogen, Minnie, Spencer, Avel, and Karen – find their lives disrupted when they begin receiving threatening messages from an anonymous assailant known only as 'A.' These messages are intricately linked to a tragic event that occurred two decades prior, involving the girls' parents and a cover-up that has haunted the town ever since. As the girls investigate the identity of 'A' and the truth behind their parents' past, they uncover a web of lies, betrayals, and hidden connections within the community. The girls must confront their own personal demons and work together to expose the truth and stop 'A' from further tormenting them. The series reveals that the actions of the parents led to a series of events that directly impacted the girls' lives, and the identity of 'A' is deeply intertwined with this history. The girls face numerous challenges and dangers as they attempt to unravel the mystery, ultimately leading to a confrontation with the person responsible for their suffering and a reckoning with the town's dark past.",
