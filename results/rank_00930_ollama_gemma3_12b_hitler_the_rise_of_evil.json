The series aims to provide a psychological portrait of a man whose actions led to unprecedented global conflict.

        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins by depicting Adolf Hitler's childhood in Austria, showcasing his struggles with authority and early artistic aspirations. It follows his experiences as a young man in Vienna, where he encounters poverty and antisemitism, shaping his worldview. The narrative then traces his involvement in the aftermath of World War I, where he joins a nationalist political group and begins to develop his extremist ideologies. As the political climate in Germany becomes increasingly unstable, Hitler's charisma and powerful speeches propel him to prominence within the Nazi Party. The series follows his rise through the ranks, detailing his manipulation of political events and his exploitation of public discontent. It portrays the consolidation of Nazi power, the systematic persecution of minorities, and the gradual descent into war, culminating in Hitler's assumption of absolute authority and the beginning of World War II. The series does not depict the final years of the war or Hitler's death, focusing instead on the critical period of his rise to power.",
