        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Following the discovery of numerous troll tribes beyond the Pop Village, Poppy, driven by her unwavering optimism, initiates a grand experiment: TrollsTopia. She invites representatives from each tribe to live together, hoping to foster harmony and understanding. The initial excitement quickly gives way to challenges as the diverse tribes, each with their unique musical styles and customs, clash. The Techno Trolls' loud music disrupts the Classical Trolls' serene environment, the Country Trolls' laid-back attitude clashes with the Hard Rock Trolls' intensity, and so on. Poppy struggles to mediate these conflicts, often relying on the support of Branch and other friends. Throughout the series, Poppy learns that true harmony isn't about everyone being the same, but about appreciating and accommodating differences. While disagreements and misunderstandings arise, the trolls ultimately learn to value each other's perspectives and find common ground, strengthening their community and celebrating their unique identities. The series culminates in a large-scale musical celebration where all the tribes come together, showcasing their individual talents and demonstrating the power of unity.",
