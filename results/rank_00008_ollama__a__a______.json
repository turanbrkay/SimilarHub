        "analytical_summary": "WandaVision follows the formerly powerful couple Wanda Maximoff and Vision as they settle into an idyllic suburban life that gradually reveals itself as a constructed reality. The series weaves together nostalgic sitcom tropes with a darker, supernatural mystery, exposing the psychological toll of grief and the fragility of identity. Through a meta‑structured, serialized format, it examines themes of love, control, and the limits of power while subverting traditional superhero storytelling. The show culminates in a dramatic unraveling of the illusion, leaving viewers to confront the cost of Wanda’s longing for a lost partner.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Season one opens with Wanda Maximoff and Vision living in the suburban town of Westview, where they appear as a perfect couple. As the series progresses, each episode adopts the style of a different classic sitcom, while subtle clues hint that the reality is fabricated. The truth gradually emerges: Wanda, grieving the death of Vision, has created a reality using her powers to keep him alive. The town is a simulation, and the residents are unaware. The series reveals that the illusion is breaking down, and the final episode shows Vision's death at the hands of a version of himself, leading Wanda to confront her grief and ultimately break the simulation, declaring herself the Scarlet Witch and ending the illusion, which collapses into a chaotic, reality‑shattering finale.",
