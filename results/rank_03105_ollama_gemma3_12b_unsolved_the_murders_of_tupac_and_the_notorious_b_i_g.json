        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series follows Detective Greg Kading's efforts to reconstruct the investigations into the murders of Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G., drawing on interviews with law enforcement officials, witnesses, and individuals connected to both artists. The documentary explores the theory that both murders were connected, potentially orchestrated by corrupt law enforcement officers and individuals within the music industry. It details the initial investigations, highlighting the challenges faced by detectives and the lack of cooperation from key witnesses. The series examines the potential involvement of Suge Knight, Death Row Records, and Bad Boy Entertainment, exploring the intense rivalry between the two labels and the potential for internal conflicts to have fueled the violence.
