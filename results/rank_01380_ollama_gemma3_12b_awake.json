        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Detective Michael Brannigan experiencing a car accident that leaves him in a state of perpetual dual reality. He exists in two separate timelines: one where his wife, Hannah, survives, and another where his son, Rex, survives. Michael is unaware of which reality is 'real' and relies on wristbands to distinguish between them. He seeks therapy from two different doctors, Jonathan Lee and Judith Evans, who are unaware of each other. As Michael investigates crimes, he utilizes information from both realities to solve cases, often leading to clashes with his colleagues who are oblivious to his unique ability. The series explores the psychological toll of living in two realities, as Michael struggles to maintain his sanity and protect his family. Throughout the series, the true nature of Michael’s condition and the origin of the dual realities remain ambiguous, leading to speculation about a larger conspiracy or supernatural phenomenon. While Michael attempts to reconcile his two lives, the series builds towards a confrontation with the forces that created his fractured existence, culminating in a final, ambiguous resolution that leaves the audience questioning the nature of reality itself.",
