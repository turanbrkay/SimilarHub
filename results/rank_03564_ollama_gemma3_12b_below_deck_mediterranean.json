While the specific charter guests and their demands change each season, the underlying tension between providing impeccable service and maintaining professional boundaries remains constant, often leading to dramatic confrontations and unexpected resolutions. The season culminates in a final charter and a crew debriefing, where the successes and failures of the season are assessed.",
