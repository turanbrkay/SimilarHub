The series explores themes of family, faith, and the psychological impact of trauma, blending elements of mystery and thriller. As the psychiatrist and her family attempt to protect the young woman, they find themselves increasingly entangled in the cult's influence, leading to escalating danger and a tense exploration of the boundaries between compassion and self-preservation.

        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Dr. Suzanne Mathis, a psychiatrist, encountering a young woman named Mae who arrives at the hospital claiming to be running from a cult. Mae, seemingly traumatized and disoriented, reveals fragments of her past within the group, known as the 'Luciferian Church.' Suzanne, concerned for Mae's well-being and recognizing the potential danger she faces, decides to provide her with shelter at her family home, despite her husband Daniel's reservations. As Mae integrates into the Mathis family, strange occurrences begin to plague the household, and Suzanne's children, JJ and Helen, become increasingly fascinated by Mae's stories and the cult's practices. It becomes clear that the cult is actively searching for Mae, and their influence extends far beyond what Suzanne initially suspected. The series follows Suzanne's attempts to protect her family while uncovering the truth about Mae's past and the cult's sinister agenda, revealing a complex web of manipulation, control, and potential violence. The cult's reach extends into the community, and Suzanne must confront the unsettling realization that the danger is closer than she thought, forcing her to make difficult choices to safeguard her loved ones.",
