        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Each episode of My Cat from Hell typically begins with a family describing the behavioral issues they are experiencing with their cat, which can range from aggression and scratching to excessive meowing and destructive habits. Jackson Galaxy then assesses the cat's environment, observing its interactions with the family and other pets.
