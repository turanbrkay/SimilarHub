        "analytical_summary": "Spy is a comedic series centered on a hapless protagonist who stumbles into a career as a secret agent. The show blends elements of workplace comedy with spy thriller tropes, creating a lighthearted and often absurd narrative. It explores themes of family dynamics, deception, and the challenges of balancing personal life with a demanding, highly unusual profession. The series derives humor from the protagonist's incompetence and the increasingly ridiculous situations he finds himself in, all while attempting to maintain a facade of normalcy for his son and ex-wife.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Philip, a struggling single father, being recruited into MI5 due to a clerical error. He assumes the identity of a seasoned agent, a role he is woefully unprepared for.

As Philip navigates increasingly complex missions, he relies on the support of his handler, Malcolm, and his quirky colleagues. The series follows Philip's attempts to maintain his cover while dealing with escalating threats and personal struggles. Throughout the show, Philip's lies become increasingly elaborate, threatening to unravel his entire life. The series culminates in a confrontation where Philip's true identity is at risk of exposure, forcing him to make difficult choices to protect his family and his career.",
