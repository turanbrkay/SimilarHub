        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Kate Wyler, a relatively inexperienced diplomat, unexpectedly appointed as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom amidst a tense standoff with Iran following an attack on a U.S. Navy destroyer. Kate, known for her crisis negotiation skills but uncomfortable in the spotlight, finds herself navigating a complex web of political agendas and personal relationships. As she attempts to de-escalate the crisis, she uncovers a conspiracy within the U.S. government, suggesting the attack may not have been accidental. Simultaneously, her marriage to Hal, a brilliant but emotionally distant political strategist, is strained by her demanding career and his own ambitions. The investigation into the attack reveals deeper layers of deception and betrayal, implicating powerful figures within both the U.S. and British governments. Kate must balance her diplomatic duties with her personal life, all while trying to uncover the truth and prevent a wider conflict. The season culminates in a precarious resolution, leaving many questions unanswered and hinting at a larger, more dangerous game at play.",
