    "overview": "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno is an American late-night talk show hosted by Jay Leno that initially aired from May 25, 1992 to May 29, 2009, and resumed production on March 1, 2010. The fourth incarnation of the Tonight Show franchise made its debut on May 25, 1992, three days following Johnny Carson's retirement as host of the program. The program originates from NBC Studios in Burbank, California, and is broadcast Monday through Friday at 11:35 PM in the Eastern and Pacific time zones. Unlike Carson or his predecessor Jack Paar, Leno only once utilized a guest host, preferring to host the series by himself.\n\nOn April 26, 1999, the show began broadcasting in 1080i HDTV, becoming the first American nightly talk show to be shot in high definition. The show is shot in 16:9 aspect ratio.\n\nThe series, which followed the same basic format as that of his predecessors, ran until May 29, 2009, after which Leno was succeeded by Conan O'Brien. NBC signed Leno to a new deal for a nightly talk show in the 10:00 pm ET timeslot. The primetime series, titled The Jay Leno Show, debuted on September 14, 2009, following a similar format to the Leno incarnation of Tonight.",

        "analytical_summary": "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno is a long-running American late-night talk show known for its consistent format and Jay Leno's hosting style. The show maintains a traditional talk show structure, featuring celebrity interviews, comedic monologues, and recurring segments. It served as a bridge between the eras of Johnny Carson and Conan O'Brien, and its move to a primetime slot demonstrated an attempt to broaden its appeal. The show's longevity and consistent viewership cemented its place as a staple of American late-night television, offering a familiar and comforting presence for audiences.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno began its run in 1992, succeeding Johnny Carson and inheriting the established format of celebrity interviews and comedic routines. Jay Leno's tenure was marked by a focus on mainstream appeal and a generally lighthearted tone, differentiating it from Carson's more sophisticated style. After a successful run, Leno stepped down in 2009, paving the way for Conan O'Brien. However, in a surprising move, NBC brought Leno back for a primetime talk show, 'The Jay Leno Show,' which attempted to broaden the show's reach but ultimately faced challenges and was later cancelled. This period highlighted the complexities of late-night television and the difficulties in reinventing a beloved franchise.",
