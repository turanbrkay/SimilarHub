        "analytical_summary": "Servant is a psychological thriller series that explores grief, denial, and the fragility of the human psyche. The show centers on a couple grappling with profound loss, who hire a young woman to pose as a nanny for their seemingly reborn son. Blending elements of horror, mystery, and domestic drama, Servant creates a claustrophobic and unsettling atmosphere, questioning the nature of reality and the lengths people will go to in order to cope with trauma. The series is characterized by its slow-burn pacing, ambiguous narrative, and unsettling visual style, offering a deeply unsettling exploration of family, faith, and the supernatural.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Dorothy and Sean Turner reeling from the death of their infant son, Jack. Unable to cope with the loss, Dorothy experiences a psychotic break and believes their son has miraculously returned. To appease her and help them process their grief, they hire Leanne Grayson, a young nanny with a mysterious past, to care for the 'reborn' Jack. As Leanne integrates into the Turner household, strange and unsettling events begin to occur, hinting at a supernatural presence and raising questions about her true identity and connection to the family. Sean, a television producer, attempts to document Dorothy’s experience for a reality show, further complicating the situation and blurring the lines between reality and performance. The investigation into Leanne’s past reveals a complex history and a connection to a religious cult, suggesting she is far more than she appears. As the truth about Jack’s origins and Leanne’s purpose is gradually revealed, the Turner family’s carefully constructed facade begins to crumble, exposing deep-seated secrets and unresolved trauma. The series culminates in a dramatic confrontation, revealing the true nature of the supernatural forces at play and leaving the future of the Turner family uncertain.",
