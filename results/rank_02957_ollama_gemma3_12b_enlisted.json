Throughout the series, they navigate various training exercises, deployments, and interactions with their fellow soldiers and commanding officers. The show explores the complexities of their relationships, revealing shared history and underlying tensions. As the series progresses, the brothers face personal challenges and professional setbacks, forcing them to confront their individual flaws and rely on each other for support.
