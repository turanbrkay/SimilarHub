        "analytical_summary": "Line of Duty is a British police procedural drama that follows the work of AC-12, a unit tasked with investigating corruption within the police force. The series is characterized by its intricate plots, morally ambiguous characters, and relentless focus on procedure. It explores themes of power, accountability, and the complexities of justice within a system often compromised by its own people. The show maintains a tense and suspenseful atmosphere, driven by its meticulous attention to detail and its willingness to challenge conventional notions of right and wrong.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with AC-12 investigating a seemingly straightforward case involving a police officer suspected of murder. As the investigation unfolds, it becomes clear that the case is far more complex, with layers of corruption and cover-ups reaching into the highest ranks of the force. Subsequent series delve deeper into systemic issues, exposing a network of officers protecting each other and manipulating investigations to avoid scrutiny. Each series presents a new 'target' for AC-12, often a charismatic and seemingly untouchable figure. The investigations frequently reveal uncomfortable truths about the police and the institutions meant to hold them accountable. Throughout the series, the team faces constant pressure and threats, blurring the lines between right and wrong and forcing them to question their own methods. The final series culminates in a sprawling investigation that exposes a deeply entrenched criminal network operating within the police force, revealing shocking connections and betrayals that shake the foundations of the entire system. While some officers face consequences for their actions, the series ultimately suggests that the fight against corruption is a never-ending battle.",
