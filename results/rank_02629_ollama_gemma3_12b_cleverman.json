The series blends crime procedural elements with science fiction and fantasy, drawing heavily on Aboriginal mythology and contemporary social issues. It follows the struggles of a young man burdened with extraordinary powers and the responsibility to mediate between humans and a marginalized population of mythological creatures. The tone is often dark and suspenseful, punctuated by moments of action and unexpected humor, offering a complex and thought-provoking commentary on societal divisions and the burden of leadership.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the emergence of the Hairypeople, beings from Aboriginal mythology, into modern-day Australia. These creatures, possessing unique abilities, are met with fear and hostility from the human population. Jarrod Slade, a reluctant and cynical young man, discovers he is a Cleverman, a being with the power to control the Hairypeople. His older brother, Dante, a more assertive and morally ambiguous figure, seeks to exploit the Hairypeople for personal gain. As tensions escalate between humans and Hairypeople, Jarrod is forced to confront his destiny and the responsibility of uniting the divided world. He navigates a complex web of political intrigue, criminal exploitation, and familial conflict, all while grappling with the weight of his powers and the potential for catastrophic consequences. The series explores the exploitation of marginalized communities, the corrupting influence of power, and the enduring legacy of colonialism, culminating in a confrontation that threatens to shatter the fragile peace between humans and Hairypeople, leaving the future uncertain.",
