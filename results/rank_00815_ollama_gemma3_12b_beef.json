        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Danny Cho, a struggling contractor, nearly colliding with Amy Lau, a successful but deeply unhappy entrepreneur, in a parking lot. A brief but intense road rage incident sparks a simmering feud between them. Initially, their retaliation is petty and impulsive – leaving negative reviews, vandalizing property, and disrupting each other's lives. As the feud intensifies, their actions become increasingly reckless and destructive, impacting not only their own lives but also the lives of those around them. Danny's family and Amy's husband, George, become entangled in their conflict, exposing vulnerabilities and secrets. The escalating conflict forces both characters to confront their own personal struggles and the underlying reasons for their anger and dissatisfaction. Ultimately, the feud reaches a dramatic climax, forcing them to re-evaluate their actions and the consequences they're having on themselves and others, leading to a complex and unexpected resolution that blurs the lines between victim and aggressor.",
