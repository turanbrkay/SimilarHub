Jimmy enters the prison, attempting to gain Hall's trust while under constant surveillance. As Jimmy and Larry develop a complex relationship, Jimmy begins to question Hall's claims and the motivations of the agents orchestrating the operation. The investigation reveals unsettling truths about the prison system, the justice system, and the potential for manipulation on all sides. The series culminates in a tense confrontation where Jimmy must decide whether to believe Hall's confession and risk his own reputation and safety, or expose the potential for a larger conspiracy.",
