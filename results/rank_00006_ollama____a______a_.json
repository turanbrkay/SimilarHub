        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. He partners with former student Jesse Pinkman to produce and sell methamphetamine, using his chemistry expertise to create a high‑purity product. Over the course of the series, Walter’s criminal enterprise expands, involving a mobile lab in an RV, a partnership with drug dealer Gustavo Fring, and a series of violent confrontations with rival dealers and law enforcement. Walter’s moral decline is mirrored by the deterioration of his marriage to Skyler and the strained relationship with his son, Flynn. Jesse struggles with guilt and addiction, ultimately becoming a reluctant partner and later a victim of Walter’s manipulation. As the drug empire grows, Walter’s alter ego, Heisenberg, asserts dominance, leading to betrayals, killings, and a series of escalating conflicts. The final season sees Walter confronting his former partners, including a showdown with the cartel and a final act of self‑sacrifice that results in his death, while Jesse escapes to a new life. The series ends with the aftermath of Walter’s actions reshaping the lives of those around him.",
