        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Ingrid Goffman, a young woman with aspirations of becoming an actress, being introduced to Adam Sterling, a celebrated but troubled actor, by his advisor, Terence. Terence proposes a unique arrangement: Ingrid will enter a marriage of convenience with Adam, fulfilling a contractual obligation for Adam to maintain a public image of stability and happiness. In exchange, Ingrid receives financial support and access to the Hollywood elite, providing a pathway to her acting career. Initially, Ingrid is hesitant, but the allure of fame and fortune proves too strong. As the arrangement progresses, Ingrid finds herself navigating a complex web of secrets, lies, and hidden agendas within Adam’s inner circle. She begins to suspect that Adam’s past is far more troubled than he lets on, and that Terence is manipulating events to serve his own purposes. Ingrid’s attempts to uncover the truth are met with resistance and danger, forcing her to question her own motivations and the true nature of her relationship with Adam. The arrangement itself becomes a source of constant tension, as Ingrid struggles to balance her personal desires with the contractual obligations she has agreed to uphold. The series explores the consequences of these choices, revealing the dark underbelly of Hollywood and the sacrifices individuals make in pursuit of their dreams.",
