        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Samantha and Jay acquire Buttonwood Manor, intending to transform it into a thriving bed and breakfast. However, they quickly realize the manor is far from empty, as it's inhabited by a diverse group of ghosts from different eras. Initially, only Samantha can perceive and interact with the ghosts, leading to chaotic and humorous misunderstandings as she tries to keep their existence a secret from Jay and potential guests. As the series progresses, Jay gradually begins to sense the ghosts' presence, deepening their connection to the manor's history and the spectral residents. The ghosts, each with their own unresolved issues and desires, often interfere with Samantha and Jay's renovation plans, leading to comedic clashes and unexpected alliances. Throughout the seasons, the series explores the individual backstories of the ghosts, revealing the events that led to their untimely deaths and their lingering attachments to Buttonwood Manor.
