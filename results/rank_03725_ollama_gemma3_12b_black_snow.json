        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins in 1995, focusing on the murder of seventeen-year-old Isabel Baker, a member of the Australian South Sea Islander community in the small town of Ashford. The case remains unsolved, casting a long shadow over the community. Twenty-five years later, the opening of a time capsule, intended to commemorate the town's history, inadvertently reopens the investigation. Cold-case detective James Cormack is assigned to the case, uncovering a web of secrets and lies that implicate various members of the community. As Cormack delves deeper, he discovers that the murder was not a random act of violence but was connected to historical injustices and systemic racism faced by the Australian South Sea Islander community. The investigation forces Cormack to confront his own biases and the uncomfortable truths about the town's past. The series reveals that several individuals had motives and opportunities to commit the crime, and the truth is far more complex than initially believed. The search for the killer exposes deep-seated tensions within the community and forces a reckoning with the town's history of prejudice and discrimination. The ultimate resolution involves a confrontation with the perpetrator and a painful but necessary process of healing and reconciliation for the community.",
