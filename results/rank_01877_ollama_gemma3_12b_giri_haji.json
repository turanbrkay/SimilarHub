        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the brutal murder of a Yakuza boss's son in Tokyo. Detective Kenzo, a man grappling with a personal tragedy and a sense of failing his duty, is tasked with finding the killer. The investigation leads him to believe that the killer has fled to London, prompting Kenzo to travel to the UK with his reluctant partner, Detective Rei Kishi. In London, Kenzo encounters a vastly different criminal landscape and must navigate the complexities of British law enforcement while pursuing the suspect, a man named Luke. As Kenzo delves deeper into the case, he discovers a connection between Luke and a past incident involving his own family, revealing a long-simmering conflict and a personal stake in the pursuit. The investigation uncovers a conspiracy involving organized crime, political corruption, and a network of individuals with hidden agendas. Ultimately, Kenzo confronts Luke, leading to a climactic showdown that forces him to confront his own demons and make a difficult choice that will determine his future and the fate of those around him. The series concludes with a sense of closure, but also with the understanding that the consequences of violence and the pursuit of justice can have lasting effects.",
