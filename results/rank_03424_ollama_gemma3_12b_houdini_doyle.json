Set in Victorian London, the show follows the unlikely partnership of famed magician Harry Houdini and author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as they investigate bizarre and often paranormal cases.

        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Houdini and Doyle, along with Stratton, investigating a series of unusual deaths seemingly linked to supernatural phenomena. Houdini, a staunch skeptic, attempts to debunk each case through logical explanations and scientific methods, while Doyle, a believer in the paranormal, seeks evidence of the supernatural. Their investigations lead them through a variety of unsettling scenarios, including encounters with alleged vampires, ghosts, and other monstrous entities. As the series progresses, the cases become increasingly complex, blurring the lines between reality and illusion. The trio uncovers a larger conspiracy involving secret societies and individuals exploiting the public's fear and fascination with the supernatural for their own nefarious purposes.
