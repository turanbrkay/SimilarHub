        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the simultaneous deaths of a seasoned police officer, John, and a teenage girl, Anya, falling from a tower block in London. Their deaths leave a five-year-old boy, John’s son, and a rookie officer, Lizzie, stranded on the roof, both vanishing shortly after. Detective Sergeant Sarah Collins is brought in to lead the investigation, tasked with finding Lizzie and uncovering the truth behind the deaths. As Sarah delves deeper, she discovers that John was investigating corruption within the police force, and Anya was involved in a complex network of relationships and secrets. The investigation reveals a connection between the two victims, suggesting a deliberate act rather than a tragic accident. Sarah uncovers a conspiracy involving powerful figures within the community, and the search for Lizzie becomes intertwined with the larger mystery. The series explores the personal lives of the characters involved, revealing their own struggles and motivations, and ultimately exposes a dark underbelly of the seemingly ordinary tower block community.",
