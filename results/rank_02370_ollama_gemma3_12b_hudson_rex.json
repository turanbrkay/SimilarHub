        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series follows Detective Charlie Hudson, a former Toronto police officer who has relocated to St. John's, Newfoundland, after a personal tragedy. He's partnered with Rex, a highly intelligent German Shepherd, who assists him in solving crimes. Each episode typically features a self-contained case, ranging from petty theft to more serious offenses, with Rex's keen sense of smell and tracking abilities proving invaluable. Recurring storylines involve Hudson adjusting to life in a new city and building relationships with his colleagues, including Sergeant Lucy Chen and Constable Frank Mazur.
