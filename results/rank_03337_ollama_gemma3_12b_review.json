    "overview": "A review of a movie, or a restaurant, or a car—or whatever else that typically falls under a critic's domain—is all well and good, and can even be helpful at times. But how can one find out about myriad other experiences that are never tackled in reviews? Enter Forrest MacNeil, a critic who goes beyond overviews of life's more-common subjects—way beyond—to satisfy the curiosity of others: The adrenaline rush of stealing; the danger of drug addiction; the delight of sleeping with a celebrity. MacNeil tries anything suggested by viewers of his TV show, then presents a 1-to-5-star review. But his unwavering commitment to experiencing intense adventures means he must deal with the unintended consequences of such a goal.",

        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Forrest MacNeil, a television critic, establishing a novel format: he reviews experiences suggested by his viewers. Initially, these suggestions are relatively benign, but as the show progresses, Forrest’s audience requests increasingly dangerous and morally questionable activities, ranging from petty theft to drug use and even sexual encounters with celebrities. Forrest meticulously documents each experience, offering his candid and often brutally honest assessments. As he delves deeper into these extreme scenarios, he grapples with the ethical implications of his actions and the impact they have on himself and those around him. The series follows Forrest’s descent into a world of increasingly risky behavior, blurring the lines between professional obligation and personal exploitation, ultimately questioning the nature of entertainment and the human desire for sensationalism. The consequences of his choices begin to mount, impacting his relationships and forcing him to confront the darker aspects of his own character.",
