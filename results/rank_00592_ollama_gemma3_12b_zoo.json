Their initial findings suggest a genetic anomaly affecting animals across species, causing them to act aggressively. As the situation escalates, the team discovers a pattern to the attacks, hinting at a coordinated effort. They encounter resistance from government agencies and corporations who seek to control the narrative and exploit the crisis for their own gain. Throughout the series, the team uncovers evidence of a mysterious 'pulse' that seems to be influencing animal behavior, leading them on a global chase for its source. They face betrayals, loss, and moral dilemmas as they struggle to contain the escalating crisis and uncover the truth behind the animal uprising. The series culminates in a confrontation with the source of the pulse, revealing a complex and unsettling truth about humanity's role in the ecological disaster and the potential for a new world order.",
