        "analytical_summary": "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit follows a New York City squad of detectives dedicated to investigating sexual crimes. The series blends procedural police work with courtroom drama, spotlighting the psychological toll on victims, investigators, and the justice system. Its gritty, realistic tone emphasizes the complexity of trauma and the moral ambiguities inherent in law enforcement. Over two decades, the show has tackled evolving social issues while maintaining a case‑of‑the‑week format that anchors its narrative.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Premiering in 1999, the series opens with the formation of the Special Victims Unit under the leadership of Detective Olivia Benson and Detective Elliot Stabler, who quickly become the core of the team. Each season presents a mix of standalone cases involving sexual assault, child abuse, and serial offenders, while also weaving longer arcs that explore the personal lives and ethical dilemmas of the detectives, forensic staff, and legal counsel. The show has introduced a rotating cast of partners and mentors, such as ADA Alexandra Cabot and Sergeant Theodore “Teddy” Lewis, and has addressed contemporary issues like cyber‑bullying, consent, and institutional accountability. While several long‑running characters have departed or been reassigned, the series continues to evolve with new leadership and investigative techniques, remaining an ongoing, high‑profile procedural drama.",
