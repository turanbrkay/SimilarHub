        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with five students – Simon, Cooper, Nate, Addy, and Jake – entering detention. Simon, a popular gossip blogger, is found dead shortly after, and the remaining four become the prime suspects. The narrative then shifts between the perspectives of Cooper, Nate, Addy, and Jake, each revealing their own secrets and motivations while attempting to clear their names. Cooper, a star athlete with a carefully constructed image, struggles to conceal his drug use and a past relationship with Simon. Nate, a privileged and often arrogant student, grapples with his family’s reputation and a hidden connection to the deceased. Addy, a seemingly perfect student, hides a troubled past and a complicated relationship with another student. Jake, a quiet and observant student, possesses a keen eye for detail and a surprising amount of knowledge about the others. As the investigation progresses, it becomes clear that Simon was actively writing a damaging blog post about one or more of the students, creating a web of resentment and potential motives. The truth behind Simon’s death is gradually unveiled, revealing a complex conspiracy involving blackmail, hidden identities, and long-held grudges. The series culminates in a confrontation where the true killer is exposed, and the remaining students must confront the consequences of their actions and the secrets they’re desperately trying to protect.",
