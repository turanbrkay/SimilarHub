        "analytical_summary": "Rick and Morty follows the misadventures of a cynical, genius scientist and his easily influenced grandson as they traverse countless realities, blending absurd sci‑fi escapades with sharp social commentary. The series juxtaposes high‑concept experiments with the mundane struggles of a fractured family, creating a darkly humorous portrait of intergenerational conflict and existential dread. Its irreverent tone and meta‑parody style continually subvert genre expectations, while the characters’ moral ambiguity invites viewers to question the cost of unchecked curiosity. Ultimately, the show thrives on its chaotic blend of satire, science fiction, and heartfelt moments of familial vulnerability.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The first season introduces Rick’s reckless adventures with Morty, culminating in the infamous ‘Pickle Rick’ episode where Rick transforms himself into a pickle to avoid family therapy, highlighting his emotional detachment. Over subsequent seasons, the duo explore alternate universes, encounter alien civilizations, and confront the consequences of their actions, such as the creation of a multiversal council and the emergence of a sentient reality‑altering entity. The narrative escalates with recurring themes of mortality, identity, and the collapse of the family unit, while each episode often ends with a twist that redefines the characters’ relationships and the universe itself. The series remains ongoing, with each new season expanding the multiverse and deepening the philosophical questions raised by Rick’s reckless genius and Morty’s growing disillusionment.",
