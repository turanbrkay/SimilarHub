He is aided by a historian, Nicole Antoinette, who provides crucial insights into the historical context of the mystery. The search for the Serpent's Kiss leads Nathan and Nicole to various historical sites, including Rosslyn Chapel and the Vatican archives, where they encounter obstacles and uncover further layers of the conspiracy.
