Set in 1930s British India, the series follows a group of Anglican nuns attempting to establish a mission in a remote Himalayan palace. The series masterfully blends religious drama with elements of psychological thriller, creating a visually stunning and emotionally intense experience.

        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with a group of young nuns, led by Sister Superior, journeying to a newly acquired palace high in the Himalayas to establish a new mission. The palace, previously occupied by a group of women who met a tragic end, is steeped in a history of forbidden love and despair. As the nuns settle in, the beauty and isolation of the location begin to unravel their carefully constructed facades. Sister Clodagh, the youngest and most idealistic of the group, struggles to maintain control as repressed desires and personal demons surface. The arrival of Digby, a local agent, further complicates matters, stirring romantic tensions and challenging the nuns' vows of celibacy. The series follows the gradual descent of the nuns into psychological turmoil, as the palace's history and the surrounding landscape seem to conspire against their efforts to maintain order and faith. The narrative culminates in a confrontation with the repressed desires and tragic history of the palace, leaving the nuns and the audience questioning the true nature of redemption and the limits of faith.",
