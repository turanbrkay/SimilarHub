        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Bo, a young girl exhibiting miraculous healing abilities, attracting the attention of both those who want to help her and those who want to control her.

As Gabe and Bo journey across the country, they encounter other 'believers' – individuals with unique abilities – some benevolent, others driven by darker motives. The narrative reveals that Bo's powers are linked to a larger, interconnected network of individuals, and that her abilities are not entirely natural, but rather the result of a complex and ethically questionable experiment.
