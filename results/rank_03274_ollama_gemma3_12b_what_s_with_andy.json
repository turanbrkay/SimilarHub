        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series follows Andy Larkin, a boy obsessed with becoming the world's greatest prankster. Each episode typically begins with Andy devising a complex prank, often targeting his family, friends, or classmates. While Andy's intentions are usually playful, his pranks frequently backfire, resulting in embarrassing or painful consequences for himself. Throughout the series, Andy learns, albeit slowly, about the importance of empathy and responsibility, though his mischievous nature remains a constant. Recurring characters, including his exasperated parents and loyal friends, provide a consistent backdrop for Andy's escalating pranks and the lessons he gradually absorbs.
