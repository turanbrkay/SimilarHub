        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series initially introduces four main characters: John Cooper, a veteran officer returning to duty after a career-threatening injury; Ben Sherman, a newly minted officer struggling to adapt to the realities of the job; Lydia Adams, a seasoned detective balancing a demanding caseload with personal struggles; and Sammy Bryant, a former detective seeking a return to the streets. Throughout the seasons, each officer confronts difficult cases that test their ethics and push them to their limits.

The series explores the consequences of choices, both on and off the job, and the enduring impact of trauma on individuals and families.
