        "analytical_summary": "Dark Angel is a historical crime drama series that delves into the chilling true story of Mary Ann Cotton, a Victorian serial killer who used arsenic poisoning to systematically murder her victims. The series explores themes of deception, greed, and the societal constraints placed upon women in the 19th century. It blends elements of a police procedural with a character study of a cunning and manipulative killer, creating a suspenseful and unsettling viewing experience. The series is notable for its exploration of a female perpetrator of crime in a time when women were often seen as innocent and vulnerable.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series follows Mary Ann Cotton as she travels throughout the North East of England, repeatedly marrying and quickly losing her husbands and stepchildren, all through the use of arsenic poisoning. Initially, the deaths are attributed to natural causes or accidents, allowing Mary Ann to inherit their money and move on to new victims. As the body count rises, suspicion begins to mount, and a local constable, William Nichols, begins to investigate the pattern of deaths. He slowly pieces together the connections between the families and the recurring presence of Mary Ann. The series chronicles William’s increasingly desperate attempts to uncover the truth and bring Mary Ann to justice, while she skillfully evades capture and continues her deadly scheme. The investigation exposes the vulnerabilities of Victorian society and the difficulty of proving a crime when the perpetrator is a seemingly respectable woman.",
