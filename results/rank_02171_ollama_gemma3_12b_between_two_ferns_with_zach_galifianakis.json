        "analytical_summary": "Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis is a unique comedy series that subverts the traditional interview format. Zach Galifianakis, as host, employs awkward, confrontational, and often nonsensical questions to interview celebrities, creating a deliberately uncomfortable and hilarious dynamic. The show's deadpan delivery and unpredictable nature contribute to its absurdist humor, offering a refreshing and unconventional take on celebrity interviews. It's a short-form series that thrives on cringe comedy and the unexpected reactions of its guests.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series follows a simple premise: Zach Galifianakis, portraying a fictionalized, inept version of himself, conducts interviews with a wide range of celebrities. Each episode features a new guest who endures Zach's bizarre and often insulting questions, delivered with a complete lack of self-awareness. The 'plot' revolves around the escalating awkwardness and the guests' attempts to maintain composure while navigating Zach's unpredictable behavior. There's no overarching narrative or character arc; instead, the humor derives from the individual interactions and the cumulative effect of Zach's consistently inappropriate questioning. The series concludes with Zach abruptly ending the interview, often with a dismissive or bizarre farewell, leaving the audience and the guest alike in a state of bewildered amusement.",
