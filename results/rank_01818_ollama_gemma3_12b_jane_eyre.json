        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Jane Eyre's unhappy childhood, marked by neglect and abuse at the hands of her aunt and cousins. She is eventually sent to Lowood School, a harsh charitable institution where she endures further hardship but also finds friendship and education. Upon leaving Lowood, Jane secures a position as a governess at Thornfield Hall, where she meets the enigmatic Mr. Rochester. A passionate and unconventional romance blossoms between them, but Jane discovers a dark secret: Rochester is already married to a woman, Bertha Mason, who is confined to the attic. Devastated, Jane flees Thornfield, finding refuge with the Rivers family, where she learns of a substantial inheritance. Torn between her feelings for Rochester and her sense of duty, she ultimately returns to Thornfield, only to find it ravaged by fire and Bertha Mason dead. Rochester, severely injured, is now a shadow of his former self, and Jane, finally free to choose, accepts his hand in marriage, finding a measure of happiness and equality.",
