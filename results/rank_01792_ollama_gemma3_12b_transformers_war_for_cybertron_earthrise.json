        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series picks up immediately after the events of 'War for Cybertron,' with the Decepticons facing dwindling resources and a desperate need to find a new home. Megatron, in a bid to secure the Decepticon's survival, initiates a plan to seize the energy source known as Dark Energon, believing it holds the key to restoring Cybertron's power. This action draws the Autobots into a fierce battle, led by Optimus Prime, who strives to protect both Cybertron and Earth from Megatron's ambitions. The Autobots discover that the Dark Energon is linked to a larger, ancient power, and their quest to understand and contain it leads them to uncover secrets about Cybertron's history and the origins of the Transformers. As the conflict intensifies, alliances shift, and characters face difficult choices that challenge their loyalties and force them to confront their own inner demons. The series culminates in a confrontation that will determine the fate of Cybertron and the potential for a lasting peace, though the cost of victory remains uncertain.",
