        "analytical_summary": "Running Wilde is a comedic series centered on the clash between wealth and idealism. The show follows Steve Wilde, a privileged and somewhat oblivious man, as he navigates the complexities of reconnecting with his childhood sweetheart, Emmy, who holds vastly different values. The series employs a farcical tone, relying on misunderstandings and absurd situations to drive the humor. It explores themes of personal growth, responsibility, and the challenges of bridging cultural divides, all while maintaining a lighthearted and often silly atmosphere.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Steve Wilde, a wealthy and carefree man, learning that his childhood sweetheart, Emmy, has returned to his life. Emmy, now an environmentalist, is living with her young daughter, Harper, and is reluctant to return to her previous life in the jungle. Emmy's mother, Karen, secretly enlists Steve's help to keep Emmy and Harper close to home, believing that Steve's presence will keep Emmy from returning to South America. Steve, eager to win Emmy's affection, agrees to the plan, leading to a series of increasingly chaotic and humorous situations. Throughout the series, Steve attempts to prove himself worthy of Emmy's love, often through misguided and self-serving actions. The dynamic between Steve, Emmy, Harper, and Karen forms the core of the show's comedic tension, as Steve struggles to understand Emmy's values and navigate the complexities of family dynamics. While Steve's attempts to win Emmy back are often clumsy and misguided, they ultimately lead to moments of personal growth and a deeper understanding of himself and the world around him. The series explores the challenges of reconciling wealth and idealism, and the importance of finding common ground despite differing values.",
