        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "In the distant future, humanity faces extinction and develops a technology to send consciousnesses back in time, inhabiting the bodies of people in the 21st century. These 'travelers' are dispatched in teams, each assigned a specific purpose and a 'Specialist' who leads the group. Initially, the teams operate with a clear directive: to prevent a future apocalyptic event. However, as the series progresses, the travelers uncover a larger conspiracy, realizing that their mission is more complex than initially presented. They encounter resistance from a shadowy organization known as the 'Resistance,' who are actively working against the travelers' efforts. Internal conflicts arise within the teams as the travelers grapple with the moral implications of their actions and the impact on the lives they're inhabiting. The overarching narrative reveals that the future is not a fixed point, and the travelers' actions have unforeseen consequences, leading to a constant reevaluation of their mission and the potential for altering the timeline in unpredictable ways. The series explores the idea that the future is not predetermined, and the travelers' actions have far-reaching effects on the past, creating a dynamic and ever-evolving narrative.",
