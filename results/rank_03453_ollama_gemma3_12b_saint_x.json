        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the idyllic vacation of the Diaz family in Saint Thomas, which is shattered by the sudden and unexplained death of their youngest daughter, Alba. Initially ruled an accidental drowning, the family struggles to cope with the loss, each member processing the tragedy in their own way. Years later, Alba’s older sister, Maya, becomes increasingly convinced that her sister’s death was not as it seemed. Driven by a desire for closure and a growing suspicion of foul play, Maya embarks on a relentless investigation, uncovering long-buried secrets and confronting uncomfortable truths about her family and the community. Her search leads her down a dangerous path, exposing a web of lies, betrayals, and hidden agendas. As Maya delves deeper, she discovers that several individuals had motives and opportunities to harm Alba, and that the truth is far more complicated and sinister than she initially imagined. The investigation forces Maya to confront her own past and the fragility of her family's bonds, ultimately leading her to a shocking revelation about the circumstances surrounding Alba's death and the identities of those responsible.",
