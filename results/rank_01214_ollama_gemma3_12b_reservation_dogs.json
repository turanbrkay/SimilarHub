The series blends humor and pathos as the characters grapple with grief, poverty, and the complexities of their cultural heritage while striving towards a shared dream of escaping to California.

        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series centers on Bear, Elora Danan, Cheese, and Willie Jack, four teenagers living on a reservation in Oklahoma. Driven by the recent death of their friend Daniel, they embark on a series of petty crimes and schemes to raise money for a trip to California, a place Daniel dreamed of visiting. Their efforts are complicated by the presence of eccentric community members, including a rival gang and a series of spiritual guides and mentors who offer both wisdom and unexpected challenges. As the series progresses, the teenagers confront their individual traumas and the weight of their community's history, leading them to question their original plan and re-evaluate their understanding of home and belonging. While the dream of California remains a driving force, the characters gradually realize that their journey is less about the destination and more about the bonds they share and the lessons they learn along the way, ultimately finding a deeper connection to their roots and a newfound appreciation for their community.",
