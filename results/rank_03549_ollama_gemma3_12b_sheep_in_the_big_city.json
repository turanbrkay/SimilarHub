    "overview": "Sheep in the Big City is an American animated television series which ran on Cartoon Network for two seasons, from November 17, 2000, to April 7, 2002. The series' pilot first premiered as part of Cartoon Network's \"Cartoon Cartoon Summer\" on August 18, 2000.\n\nCreated by Mo Willems, the bulk of the show follows a runaway sheep, Sheep, in its new life in \"the Big City\". It also features several unrelated sketches and shorts, similar to The Rocky & Bullwinkle Show. With an emphasis on more \"sophisticated\" humor, using multiple forms of rhetoric from the characters to the plots, it was more popular with older audiences. It was also unusual in featuring many comic references to film-making and television broadcasting.\n\nAt the time, the premiere of Sheep in the Big City was the highest-rated premiere for a Cartoon Network original series.",

The show distinguishes itself with its sophisticated humor, incorporating elements of satire and meta-commentary on filmmaking and television. Aimed at a slightly older audience, it blends absurdist situations with clever wordplay and visual gags, creating a unique and often surreal comedic experience. The series' unconventional style and self-aware nature set it apart from typical children's animation.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series centers on Sheep, who escapes from a rural farm and finds himself in the bustling Big City.
