        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the sudden reappearance of several former Alcatraz inmates, seemingly having vanished in 1963. A special team is assembled, comprised of FBI agent Emerson Hauser, San Francisco police officer Lucy Diamond, and novelist Benoit Madoux, to investigate these bizarre events. As the team delves deeper, they discover that the inmates' disappearances were part of a larger, cyclical phenomenon linked to ancient mythology and powerful, otherworldly beings. The reappearing inmates are not simply returning; they are being manipulated and controlled by these entities, who are using Alcatraz as a nexus point for their own purposes. The team uncovers a complex web of historical events and secret societies, revealing that Alcatraz has been a site of supernatural activity for centuries. Throughout the investigation, each member of the team confronts personal demons and grapples with the implications of the unfolding mystery, ultimately realizing that they are pawns in a game far beyond their comprehension.
