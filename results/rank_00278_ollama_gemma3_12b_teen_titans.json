        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Robin assembling a team of young heroes – Starfire, Raven, Cyborg, and Beast Boy – to combat threats too large for individual heroes to handle. Each Titan grapples with their own personal issues: Starfire struggles to understand Earth customs and control her immense power, Raven battles her demonic heritage and emotional instability, Cyborg deals with the implications of his cybernetic enhancements, and Beast Boy learns to control his shapeshifting abilities. Throughout the series, the Titans face a recurring threat from Slade, a powerful and manipulative villain who seeks to corrupt and destroy them. Slade often targets the Titans' weaknesses, exploiting their personal struggles to undermine their teamwork and resolve. As the series progresses, the Titans confront increasingly complex challenges, forcing them to confront their own limitations and grow as individuals and as a team. The final confrontations with Slade reveal deeper connections and motivations, culminating in a climactic battle that tests the Titans' strength and resolve.",
