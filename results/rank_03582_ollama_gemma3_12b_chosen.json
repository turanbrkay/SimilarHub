        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Ian Mitchell, a lawyer and family man, receives a mysterious package containing a photograph and instructions to assassinate the pictured individual. Shortly after, he is targeted for attack, revealing his involvement in a deadly game controlled by The Watchers, a secretive organization. Ian discovers that he and others have been 'chosen' to participate in this lethal competition, where they are pitted against each other, manipulated, and forced to confront their own morality. As Ian investigates the Watchers, he uncovers a complex web of power, deception, and a history far more intricate than he initially imagined. He learns that the 'choices' presented to him are not random, but carefully orchestrated to serve a larger, unknown purpose.
