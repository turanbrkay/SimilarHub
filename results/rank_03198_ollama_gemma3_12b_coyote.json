        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Ben Clemens, a dedicated border patrol agent of 32 years, facing unexpected circumstances. A series of events, involving his son, forces him to accept a deal: he must work with a Mexican drug cartel to protect his family.

As he navigates this new role, he begins to question his long-held beliefs about law enforcement and the effectiveness of border security measures. He encounters individuals whose stories challenge his black-and-white worldview, forcing him to confront the human cost of his actions and the systemic issues that drive the flow of people across the border. The series follows Ben's journey as he grapples with his conscience, attempts to reconcile his past with his present, and ultimately confronts the consequences of his choices, all while trying to safeguard his family’s well-being. The narrative explores the blurred lines between right and wrong, and the sacrifices individuals make in the name of survival and loyalty.",
