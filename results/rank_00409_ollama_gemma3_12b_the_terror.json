        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The first season, 'Infamy,' centers on the ill-fated Franklin expedition to the Arctic in 1848. The crew, led by Captain John Franklin, is searching for the Northwest Passage when they encounter a mysterious creature – an ancient, intelligent predator known as the Tuunbaq. The series follows the crew's desperate struggle for survival as they are hunted and slowly succumb to starvation, madness, and the relentless pursuit of the Tuunbaq. Internal conflicts and the breakdown of discipline further exacerbate their plight. The narrative explores the clash between the expedition's ambition and the unforgiving power of nature, culminating in a tragic and inevitable demise for most of the crew. Subsequent seasons explore different historical events and settings, maintaining the core premise of a group facing extraordinary and terrifying challenges.",
