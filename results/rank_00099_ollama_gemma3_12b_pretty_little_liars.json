        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins a year after Alison DiLaurentis mysteriously disappears, leaving her four closest friends – Spencer Hastings, Hanna Marin, Aria Montgomery, and Emily Fields – reeling from the loss and burdened by secrets Alison knew. Soon after, they begin receiving cryptic messages from someone calling themselves 'A,' who threatens to expose their darkest secrets.
