        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins in 1983 with Joe MacMillan, a charismatic but enigmatic former IBM salesman, attempting to launch a personal computer company, Visionary, in Los Angeles. He recruits Cameron Howe, a brilliant but rebellious teenage hacker, and Gordon Clark, a talented but insecure engineer, to help him realize his ambitious goals. Visionary’s initial product, a Macintosh clone, struggles to gain traction, leading to internal conflicts and ultimately, its collapse. The team then relocates to Boston, where they attempt to create a graphics card, but again face setbacks and betrayals. A significant turning point involves the revelation of Joe’s past connection to IBM and his motivations for disrupting the industry. The series progresses through the late 1980s and early 1990s, following the characters as they navigate the evolving tech scene, including the rise of the internet and the shift towards digital media. Relationships evolve and fracture, with betrayals and reconciliations shaping the characters' trajectories. The final season sees the team attempting to create a digital video camera, reflecting on their past achievements and the lasting impact of their work, culminating in a poignant reflection on legacy and the ephemeral nature of innovation.",
