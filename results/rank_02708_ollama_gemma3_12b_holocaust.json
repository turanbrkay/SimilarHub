        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins in 1935, depicting the wedding of Karl Weiss, a Jewish painter, and Inga Helms, a Christian woman. As the Nazi regime consolidates power, the Weiss family and other Jewish characters face increasing discrimination and persecution. Karl's family members are gradually stripped of their rights and possessions, forced to register, and eventually deported to concentration camps.
