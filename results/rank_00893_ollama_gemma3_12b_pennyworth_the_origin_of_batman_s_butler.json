        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Alfred Pennyworth, a decorated former SAS soldier, struggling to find his place in post-war London. He and his business partner, Spencer Smythe, form Pennyworth & Smythe Security, a firm initially providing protection for various criminal enterprises.

As Alfred becomes increasingly involved in the Waynes’ affairs, he uncovers a web of conspiracies, betrayals, and dangerous secrets that threaten their lives and his own. Spencer’s involvement with a shadowy organization known as The Raven Society complicates matters further, forcing Alfred to navigate treacherous alliances and confront powerful enemies. The series explores the origins of the Wayne family’s wealth and influence, revealing the sacrifices and compromises made to secure their position. While the Waynes appear to be building a philanthropic empire, their past actions and connections to criminal elements create a precarious foundation for the future Bruce Wayne will inherit.
