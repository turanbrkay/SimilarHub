        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series initially centers on Howard Moon and Aaron Cook's employment at the Mossy Bottom Zoo, where they dream of musical stardom. Each episode typically involves a new, often outlandish, quest or adventure, frequently involving encounters with fantastical creatures, eccentric characters, and bizarre situations. Howard, the self-proclaimed intellectual and aspiring shaman, often clashes with Aaron's more laid-back and impulsive nature. Throughout the series, they pursue various musical endeavors, encountering rival musicians and navigating the complexities of the music industry. The narrative progresses through increasingly surreal and interconnected storylines, culminating in a final arc that sees the characters confronting their past and embracing their unique identities. While the initial seasons focus on episodic adventures, later seasons weave a more complex narrative, exploring themes of friendship, ambition, and self-discovery.",
