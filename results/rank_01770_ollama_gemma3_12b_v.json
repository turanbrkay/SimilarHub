        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the arrival of seemingly benevolent aliens, the Visitors, who present themselves as peaceful explorers seeking to share advanced technology with humanity. However, a small group of humans, led by Diana, discovers the Visitors' true form: reptilian humanoids with a hidden agenda to exploit Earth's resources and enslave its population. As the Visitors gain influence and trust, the resistance movement struggles to expose their deception and rally support. Internal conflicts and betrayals within the resistance complicate their efforts, while the Visitors employ sophisticated tactics to maintain control and eliminate threats.
