        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins in the days leading up to Hurricane Katrina, establishing the staff and patients at Memorial Medical Center. As the storm intensifies and makes landfall, the hospital loses power and quickly becomes isolated. With no electricity, backup generators fail, and the heat becomes unbearable, threatening the lives of vulnerable patients. Faced with dwindling supplies and the inability to transfer patients to safer locations, the medical team, led by Dr. Shantrelle Baptiste and Administrator Thorndike, makes the agonizing decision to administer sedatives to keep patients comfortable and conserve resources. As the days pass, the situation deteriorates, and the ethical implications of their actions become increasingly fraught. Investigations into the deaths that occurred at Memorial after the storm begin, focusing on the decisions made by the medical staff and the potential for criminal negligence. The series follows multiple perspectives, including those of the doctors, nurses, patients, and the investigators, revealing the complex web of responsibility and the lasting trauma inflicted by the disaster. The narrative culminates in a legal reckoning, forcing the characters to confront the consequences of their actions and grapple with the weight of their decisions.",
