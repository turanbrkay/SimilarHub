        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Michael Westen abruptly finding himself unable to access his accounts and resources, effectively blacklisted from the intelligence community. He's stranded in Miami, forced to rely on his former handler, Fiona Glenanne, and his mother, Madeline Westen, for support. As he navigates this new reality, he uses his skills to assist ordinary people facing extraordinary problems, often involving criminal activity or injustice. Throughout the series, Michael investigates the circumstances of his burn notice, uncovering a complex web of conspiracies and betrayals within his former agency. He is aided by his friends Sam Axe, a former Navy SEAL, and Jesse Porter, a skilled thief and information broker. As Michael gets closer to the truth, he faces increasingly dangerous adversaries, including former colleagues and powerful figures who want to keep his past buried. The investigation reveals a deep-seated corruption within the agency, and Michael must confront those responsible while protecting his loved ones. The series culminates in a final confrontation where Michael uncovers the full extent of the conspiracy and must make a difficult choice that will determine his future and the fate of those around him.",
