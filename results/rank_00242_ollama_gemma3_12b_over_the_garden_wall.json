        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The story begins with Wirt and Greg, brothers with contrasting personalities, accidentally stumbling into the Unknown, a strange and timeless forest. Greg, ever optimistic and accompanied by his pet frog, is largely oblivious to the dangers, while Wirt, a more cynical and anxious older brother, struggles to maintain control and find a way back home. They are guided by a mysterious Woodsman who warns them of the forest's perils and the Beast that lurks within. Along their journey, they encounter a variety of peculiar inhabitants, including a pumpkin-headed man, a singing door keeper, and a group of dancing skeletons. Beatrice, a bluebird, initially serves as their reluctant guide, harboring a personal vendetta against the Woodsman. As they travel, Wirt grapples with feelings of inadequacy and responsibility, while Greg's innocence and unwavering belief in the good of others challenge Wirt's pessimism. Eventually, they discover that the Woodsman is connected to Beatrice's past and that their journey is intertwined with the forest's history. The brothers confront the Beast, a manifestation of the forest's darkness, and ultimately find their way back to their own world, forever changed by their experiences.",
