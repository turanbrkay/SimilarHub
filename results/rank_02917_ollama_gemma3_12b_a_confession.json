        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the disappearance of a young woman, Sophie Mason, and quickly focuses on the investigation led by Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher. Initial suspects are pursued and eliminated, leading Fulcher to focus on Mark Lewis, a seemingly ordinary man who initially denies involvement. As evidence mounts, Fulcher makes a controversial decision to confront Lewis outside of standard police protocol, believing it will elicit a confession. This unorthodox approach leads to a confession from Lewis, but also exposes Fulcher to intense scrutiny and ultimately leads to his downfall. The series then delves into the aftermath of the case, examining the legal challenges and professional repercussions faced by Fulcher, highlighting the systemic pressures and ethical dilemmas inherent in the pursuit of justice. The narrative culminates in a stark portrayal of the personal cost of Fulcher's actions and the long shadow cast by the case.",
