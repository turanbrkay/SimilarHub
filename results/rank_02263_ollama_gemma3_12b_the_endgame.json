        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the capture of Elena Federova, a notorious international arms dealer, who seemingly poses little threat behind bars. However, it quickly becomes apparent that Elena is far from contained, orchestrating a series of meticulously planned bank heists from within prison. FBI Agent Val Turner, a brilliant but socially awkward investigator, is assigned to stop her, finding himself constantly outmaneuvered and forced to question his own assumptions. As Val delves deeper into Elena's operation, he uncovers a vast network of collaborators and a complex web of personal connections that challenge his understanding of justice. The heists are revealed to be part of a larger, more ambitious plan, with Elena manipulating events to achieve a specific, yet initially unclear, goal. Throughout the series, Val struggles to anticipate Elena's next move, often finding himself caught in her elaborate schemes. The narrative explores Elena's motivations, revealing a tragic backstory that complicates her portrayal as a purely villainous figure. The series culminates in a confrontation where Val must confront not only Elena but also the systemic flaws that allowed her criminal enterprise to flourish, leaving the audience to question the true meaning of victory.",
