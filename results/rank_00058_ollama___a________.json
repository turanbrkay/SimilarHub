        "analytical_summary": "What If...? is a Marvel Cinematic Universe anthology that reimagines pivotal moments, exploring how small changes can ripple across reality. The series blends high‑fantasy, sci‑fi, and superhero tropes in a stylized animation, using each episode as a self‑contained thought experiment. It examines the fragility of destiny, the weight of responsibility, and the moral complexity of heroism, often ending with a bittersweet or dark twist. The show appeals to fans who crave alternate takes on familiar characters while offering philosophical commentary on choice and consequence.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Season 1 follows six self‑contained episodes. In the first episode, Thor keeps Mjolnir and returns to Earth, becoming a reluctant hero who ultimately sacrifices himself to save New York. The second episode shows Hulk never losing control; he becomes a compassionate protector of a village and is celebrated as a hero. In the third episode, Captain America never wakes from the ice, turning into a tyrant ruler of a dystopian world. The fourth episode features Black Widow surviving the mission that killed her, leading to a different alliance with the Avengers and a new fate for the team. The fifth episode depicts Spider‑Man surviving the battle with Green Goblin, resulting in a different path for Peter Parker and a new mentor relationship. The final episode, “What If… the world had been different?”, explores a multiverse where the Avengers are a different group, culminating in a new portal that hints at future possibilities. The series concludes without a definitive overarching narrative, leaving each alternate reality open‑ended.",
