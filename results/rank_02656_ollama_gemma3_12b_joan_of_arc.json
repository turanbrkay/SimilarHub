        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Joan's childhood in Domrémy, where she experiences the devastation of war firsthand. As she grows, she begins to receive visions and hears voices that she believes are divine, urging her to aid the Dauphin, Charles, in reclaiming the French throne from the English. Joan travels to Vaucouleurs and convinces Robert de Baudricourt to provide her with an escort to Chinon, where she meets Charles. After proving her identity to Charles, she is given command of a French army and leads them to victory at Orléans, significantly boosting French morale and turning the tide of the war. Joan continues to lead French forces, liberating several cities and paving the way for Charles's coronation at Reims. However, her successes are met with political maneuvering and betrayal. Joan is eventually captured by Burgundian forces, sold to the English, and put on trial for heresy. Despite her impassioned defense, she is found guilty and burned at the stake. Years later, Charles, now King, initiates a posthumous inquiry into Joan's trial, which ultimately declares her innocent and recognizes her as a saint.",
