Early seasons focus on the sisters learning to harness their abilities and battling various demons and warlocks, often with the help of their loyal friends, Andy and Darryl. As the series progresses, the sisters face increasingly complex threats, including the death of Prue, which profoundly impacts the family and forces Piper to assume a leadership role.
