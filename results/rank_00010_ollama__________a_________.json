        "analytical_summary": "The Big Bang Theory follows a group of socially awkward physicists—Leonard, Sheldon, Howard, and Raj—whose lives are disrupted when Penny, an aspiring actress, moves in next door. The series blends scientific humor with everyday romance, chronicling the characters’ growth from isolated nerds to a close-knit family. Its tone is light‑hearted and witty, punctuated by recurring jokes about pop culture and the characters’ idiosyncratic habits. Over its twelve‑season run, the show explores themes of friendship, love, and the clash between intellect and social norms.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series opens with Leonard and Sheldon living together in an apartment in Pasadena, California, while their friends Howard and Raj work at a university physics department. Penny, a free‑spirited aspiring actress, moves into the apartment building next door, sparking a series of comedic interactions that gradually develop into a romantic relationship with Leonard. Throughout the seasons, the group navigates personal and professional challenges: Sheldon’s rigid routines clash with the evolving dynamics of the group; Howard’s career as an aerospace engineer and Raj’s struggle with social anxiety create subplots; and the characters experience significant growth, including Sheldon’s eventual acceptance of emotional vulnerability and the group’s support of each other’s ambitions. The series concludes with the main characters solidifying their relationships, pursuing their careers, and continuing to enjoy their close friendship, leaving the audience with a sense of continuity and optimism.",
