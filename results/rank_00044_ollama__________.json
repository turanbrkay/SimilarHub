        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Elliot Alderson, a cybersecurity engineer with dissociative identity disorder, is recruited by the enigmatic Mr. Robot to join fsociety, a hacktivist group that plans a massive cyber‑attack on the conglomerate E Corp. In Season 1, Elliot and fsociety succeed in wiping out E Corp’s debt records, but the fallout forces Elliot into a mental hospital where he confronts the split between his own identity and the persona of Mr. Robot, who is revealed to be a manifestation of his deceased father. Season 2 sees Elliot attempting to kill Mr. Robot and unravel the conspiracy that has tied him to a global network of corporate control, only to discover that the mastermind behind the plot is himself, manipulating events from within. By Season 3, Elliot is a fugitive living in a new identity, constantly battling his internal demons while trying to expose the truth about the E Corp hack and the hidden agendas of the government and corporate elite. Season 4 escalates the stakes as Elliot’s alter ego, Mr. Robot, orchestrates a plan to dismantle the power structures that control society, while Elliot struggles to maintain sanity and protect those he cares about. In the final Season 5, Elliot is confined to a psychiatric facility, where he confronts the reality that his entire narrative may have been a construct of his own mind. The series concludes with Elliot escaping the hospital, adopting a new name, and stepping into an uncertain future—leaving his fate ambiguous but suggesting a continued fight against the systemic injustices that defined his life.",
