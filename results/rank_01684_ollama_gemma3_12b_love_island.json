Throughout their stay, new islanders are introduced, disrupting existing pairings and creating opportunities for new connections. The public plays a crucial role, voting for their favorite couples and influencing who remains in the villa. Islanders face challenges and games designed to test their relationships and reveal hidden feelings. Strategic alliances and betrayals are common as contestants vie for popularity and a chance to win a cash prize. As the season progresses, couples are eliminated, and the remaining islanders must continually re-evaluate their relationships and adapt to changing dynamics.
