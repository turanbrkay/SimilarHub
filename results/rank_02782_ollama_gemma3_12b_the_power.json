        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the simultaneous manifestation of electrical abilities in teenage girls across the globe. Initially, the phenomenon is met with confusion and fear, quickly escalating into widespread panic as the potential for misuse becomes apparent. Governments struggle to contain the situation, while underground movements and extremist groups emerge, seeking to exploit the power for their own agendas. The narrative follows several key characters: Allie, a young woman struggling to control her abilities; Roxy, a charismatic leader of a girls' collective; and Tariq, an FBI agent investigating the origins of the power. As the girls' collective gains momentum, they challenge existing power structures and advocate for a new world order. The series explores the complex moral dilemmas faced by individuals on all sides of the conflict, as the balance of power shifts dramatically. The emergence of a 'prime' – a girl with significantly amplified abilities – further complicates the situation, threatening to destabilize the fragile peace. The narrative culminates in a global confrontation, with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance, as the girls' collective and established authorities clash over the future of the world.",
