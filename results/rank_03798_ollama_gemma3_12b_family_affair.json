        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Bill Davis, a successful civil engineer, unexpectedly taking custody of his deceased brother’s children: 15-year-old Cissy and the precocious 6-year-old twins, Jody and Buffy. Bill's life is upended as he navigates the responsibilities of parenthood while maintaining his bachelor lifestyle.
