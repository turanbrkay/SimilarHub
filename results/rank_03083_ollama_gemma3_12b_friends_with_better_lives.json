        "analytical_summary": "Friends with Better Lives is a comedic exploration of modern relationships and the anxieties of comparing oneself to others. The series follows six friends navigating different life stages – marriage, divorce, engagement, and singlehood – as they grapple with the illusion of happiness and the unspoken question of who truly has it better. The show blends situational comedy with relatable themes of envy, regret, and the search for fulfillment, offering a lighthearted yet insightful look at the complexities of adult friendships and the pressures of societal expectations.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Andi and Bobby, a seemingly perfect married couple with children, questioning their carefree past. Will, recently divorced, attempts to embrace the single life but struggles with lingering feelings for his ex-wife. Jules and Lowell are enjoying the excitement of a new relationship, while Kate, a successful career woman, faces a crisis of contentment when she witnesses Jules' engagement. Throughout the series, the friends cycle through moments of joy and insecurity, constantly evaluating their choices and comparing their lives to those of their peers. Relationships are tested, secrets are revealed, and the characters confront the uncomfortable truth that happiness is not a competition, but a personal journey. While the series maintains a comedic tone, it explores the underlying anxieties of modern life and the challenges of maintaining authentic connections in a world saturated with curated online personas. The series concludes with the friends gaining a deeper understanding of themselves and each other, recognizing that true happiness lies not in external validation but in embracing their individual paths and supporting one another through life's ups and downs.",
