It becomes apparent that an alien entity has infiltrated Earth, exploiting the inherent trust and love parents have for their children to manipulate them. As the situation escalates, a group of parents band together to uncover the truth behind the phenomenon, facing mounting evidence that their children are being used as pawns in a larger, extraterrestrial plan.
