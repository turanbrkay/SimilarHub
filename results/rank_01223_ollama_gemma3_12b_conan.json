The show blends traditional talk show elements with sketch comedy and musical performances, often pushing boundaries and embracing a playful, irreverent tone. It serves as a platform for O'Brien's unique brand of comedy and provides a space for showcasing emerging talent and engaging in topical discussions. The show's success lies in its ability to consistently deliver unexpected and entertaining content, appealing to a broad audience seeking a refreshing alternative to conventional late-night programming.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Conan began as a continuation of O'Brien's previous late-night show, initially maintaining a familiar format. However, as the series progressed, it increasingly embraced more experimental and absurdist segments, often featuring elaborate sketches, musical numbers, and recurring characters. The show frequently incorporated self-referential humor, poking fun at the conventions of late-night television and O'Brien's own career. Celebrity interviews remained a core element, but were often punctuated by unexpected comedic interventions and playful interactions. The show's evolution reflected O'Brien's desire to push creative boundaries and maintain a distinctive voice in a competitive landscape, culminating in a format that prioritized unconventional humor and audience engagement over strict adherence to traditional talk show structures. The show's longevity is a testament to its ability to adapt and reinvent itself while retaining its core comedic identity.",
