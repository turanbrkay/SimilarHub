        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with James Cole, a convict from 2043, involuntarily sent back to 2015 as part of a desperate attempt to prevent the release of the Army of the 12 Monkeys virus, which decimated the human population. Initially believing he is the virus's source, Cole struggles to understand his mission and the complex web of events surrounding it. He encounters Dr. Cassandra Railton, a brilliant virologist whose father's research is crucial to understanding the virus's origins. As Cole travels through different points in time, he uncovers a conspiracy far larger than he initially imagined, involving shadowy organizations and manipulations of history. He forms uneasy alliances and confronts betrayals, all while grappling with the psychological toll of his mission and the potential for altering the timeline with unforeseen consequences. The series reveals that the Army of the 12 Monkeys is not simply a terrorist group, but a complex organization with roots in the past, and that Cole's own existence is intertwined with the virus's creation. Ultimately, Cole must confront his own identity and purpose as he attempts to prevent the apocalypse, even if it means sacrificing his own future.",
