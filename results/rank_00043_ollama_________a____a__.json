        "analytical_summary": "Better Call Saul follows Jimmy McGill’s gradual descent from a struggling, idealistic lawyer to the morally ambiguous, flamboyant criminal attorney Saul Goodman. Set in contemporary Albuquerque, the series interweaves legal drama with crime thriller elements, exploring themes of identity, ambition, and the corrupting influence of power. Its tone balances sharp wit with gritty realism, while its character arcs reveal the fragile line between redemption and self-destruction.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Jimmy McGill begins the series as a small‑time lawyer with a conscience, working for the law firm Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill while attempting to help his brother, Chuck, and later becoming a fixer for the criminal underworld. Over six seasons he embraces a series of increasingly unethical schemes, forming a partnership with the seasoned fixer Mike Ehrmantraut and a friendship with the drug‑literate Walter White. Jimmy’s transformation culminates in him adopting the alias Saul Goodman, a flamboyant criminal lawyer who thrives on deception and manipulation. Mike’s arc ends tragically when he is shot in the final episode of season five, and he dies in a hospital, leaving Jimmy to confront the consequences of his choices. The series concludes with Jimmy in a prison cell, fully embracing his new identity as Saul, while the narrative threads of his past and future intersect with the larger Breaking Bad universe.",
