Initially motivated solely by a desire to avoid recapture, Peacemaker gradually begins to form bonds with his teammates, confronting his own violent tendencies and the legacy of his abusive father, Eagan. The team investigates the Butterflies' insidious plan to implant their larvae into human hosts, turning them into mindless drones. As they delve deeper, they uncover a complex conspiracy involving government officials and a disturbing connection to Peacemaker's past. Throughout the season, Peacemaker struggles with his inner demons, attempting to reconcile his desire for peace with his ingrained need for violence, ultimately leading to a confrontation with his father and a desperate attempt to save the world from the Butterfly invasion.",
