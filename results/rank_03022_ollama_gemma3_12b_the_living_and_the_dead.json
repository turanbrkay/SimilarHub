The series explores themes of grief, trauma, and the fragility of the human mind, set against a backdrop of rural isolation and societal expectations. The narrative unfolds as a pioneering psychologist and his wife confront a series of unsettling events on his family's estate, blurring the lines between rational explanation and the possibility of something otherworldly.
