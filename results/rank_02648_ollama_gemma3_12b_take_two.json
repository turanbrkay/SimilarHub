        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Sam Swift, a once-beloved actress whose career imploded after a highly publicized mental health crisis. Desperate to return to acting, she convinces the reluctant Eddie Valetik, a gruff and solitary private investigator, to let her shadow him as research for a potential comeback role. Initially, Eddie views Sam as a nuisance, but her acting skills and surprising intuition prove valuable in solving cases. As they work together, Sam begins to confront the underlying issues that led to her breakdown, while Eddie is forced to confront his own emotional isolation. The cases they handle often reflect Sam’s personal journey, forcing her to examine her past mistakes and the impact they had on those around her. While Sam’s acting career remains a central goal, the series increasingly focuses on the evolving relationship between her and Eddie, as they learn to rely on each other and challenge their preconceived notions about themselves and the world. The series explores the challenges of rebuilding trust and reputation, both professionally and personally, as Sam strives to prove herself worthy of a second chance.",
