        "analytical_summary": "Are You Afraid of the Dark? is a Canadian-American anthology series geared towards a younger audience, presenting standalone horror and fantasy tales framed by a recurring group of friends. The show blends spooky narratives with a sense of youthful camaraderie, exploring themes of fear, imagination, and the power of storytelling. Each episode offers a unique and self-contained experience, creating a consistently unsettling yet ultimately comforting atmosphere. The series' longevity and revival demonstrate its enduring appeal to audiences seeking accessible and imaginative horror.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series revolves around the Midnight Society, a group of friends who gather around a campfire to share scary stories. Each story is presented as a 'tale' told by one of the members, ranging from supernatural encounters to psychological thrillers. The initial episodes establish the core dynamic of the group and the format of the anthology. Later seasons introduce new members and experiment with different storytelling approaches, including a miniseries that blurs the lines between the fictional tales and the reality of the Midnight Society itself. Recurring motifs include cursed objects, haunted locations, and the exploration of childhood fears. While the individual stories are self-contained, the overarching narrative focuses on the power of storytelling and the bonds of friendship within the Midnight Society.",
