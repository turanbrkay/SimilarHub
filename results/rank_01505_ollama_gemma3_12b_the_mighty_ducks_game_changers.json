His mother, Alex, a former college hockey player, recognizes Evan’s disappointment and the negative impact of the Ducks’ win-at-all-costs mentality. Determined to give Evan a positive hockey experience, Alex decides to form her own team, recruiting a group of misfit kids who have been overlooked or discouraged from playing. Initially struggling to find their footing and facing resistance from the Ducks’ coach, Coach Gordie, Alex and the new team gradually develop their skills and build a strong sense of camaraderie. Throughout the season, they confront challenges both on and off the ice, learning valuable lessons about leadership, resilience, and the true meaning of teamwork.
