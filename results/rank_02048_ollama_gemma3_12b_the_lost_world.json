        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with a team of explorers, led by a driven paleontologist, embarking on an expedition to locate a rumored lost world. A catastrophic hot-air balloon crash leaves them stranded on a remote plateau teeming with dinosaurs, previously thought extinct. The initial focus is on survival, as the team struggles to secure resources and evade the various prehistoric creatures. As they delve deeper into the plateau, they discover a complex ecosystem and evidence of a previous human presence, hinting at a darker history. Conflicts arise within the group, driven by differing scientific agendas and the psychological toll of their isolation. The paleontologist's ambition to study the dinosaurs clashes with the concerns of others who prioritize escape and preservation. The series culminates in a confrontation with the plateau's dominant predator, forcing the survivors to make difficult choices about their future and the fate of the lost world. The survivors eventually manage to signal for rescue, but the experience leaves a lasting impact, raising questions about the responsibility of humanity in the face of such extraordinary discoveries.",
