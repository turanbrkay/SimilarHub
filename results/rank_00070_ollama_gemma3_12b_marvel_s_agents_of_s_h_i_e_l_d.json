The team faces betrayal and must rebuild, often dealing with the consequences of their actions and the emergence of new threats linked to the alien race known as the Kree. Later seasons introduce alternate realities and timelines, forcing the team to confront versions of themselves and grapple with the complexities of manipulating time. The team experiences significant losses and gains new members, constantly evolving to face increasingly powerful adversaries, ultimately culminating in a final confrontation that tests their loyalty and resolve.",
