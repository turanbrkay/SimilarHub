They are joined by Oscar, a talking pug who serves as their guide and confidant. As they navigate the park's various haunted attractions, they encounter a host of demons, ghosts, and other supernatural beings, often uncovering sinister plots and hidden agendas. The teens gradually learn about the park's true purpose: a gateway for demonic forces to enter the human world. They uncover a conspiracy involving the park's founder, Roger, who is revealed to be a powerful demon himself.
