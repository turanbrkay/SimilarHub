        "analytical_summary": "Black Mirror is an anthology series that examines the dark side of modern technology, using speculative fiction to explore how digital devices shape identity, relationships, and society. Each episode presents a self-contained narrative that often ends with a chilling twist, underscoring the moral and ethical dilemmas of a hyperconnected world. The tone is cynical and unsettling, blending satire with psychological drama to provoke reflection on our collective future. The series has become a cultural touchstone for its incisive critique of media, surveillance, and human behavior in a near-future setting.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series follows a series of unrelated stories set in a near-future world where technology is ubiquitous, each episode exploring a different facet of digital culture—from social-media obsession to AI-driven surveillance. The narrative structure is episodic, with no overarching plot, but recurring themes of alienation, identity loss, and moral ambiguity recur throughout. The series has continued to release new seasons, each adding fresh speculative scenarios that reflect contemporary anxieties about technology.",
