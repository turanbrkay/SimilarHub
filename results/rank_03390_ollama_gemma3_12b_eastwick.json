Initially, they embrace their powers, using them to improve their lives and exact revenge on those who have wronged them. However, their newfound abilities soon attract unwanted attention, and they discover that Darryl’s intentions are far more complex and potentially dangerous than they initially believed. The women must learn to control their powers and work together to uncover the truth about Darryl and the dark secrets hidden within Eastwick, facing escalating conflicts and personal sacrifices along the way.
