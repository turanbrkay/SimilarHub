        "analytical_summary": "28 Days Haunted is a reality television series that blends paranormal investigation with a structured experiment. Inspired by the methodologies of Ed and Lorraine Warren, the show features teams of paranormal enthusiasts spending extended periods in purportedly haunted locations. The series aims to provide a scientific approach to the study of hauntings, documenting experiences and attempting to establish patterns. The format combines elements of suspense, psychological exploration, and the pursuit of empirical evidence within the realm of the supernatural. It offers viewers a glimpse into the world of paranormal research while maintaining a focus on the human reactions to potentially frightening experiences.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Each season of 28 Days Haunted centers around three separate teams, each assigned to a different location believed to be intensely haunted. The teams, comprised of paranormal investigators, mediums, and other specialists, are tasked with conducting 28-day investigations, adhering to protocols established based on the techniques used by Ed and Lorraine Warren. Throughout their stays, the teams document their experiences, utilizing various recording devices and attempting to establish a baseline of activity before the investigation begins. The series chronicles the teams' escalating psychological and emotional responses to the perceived paranormal activity, often highlighting disagreements and tensions within the groups as they grapple with the unsettling environment. While the series aims for a scientific approach, the subjective nature of paranormal experiences and the potential for psychological suggestion often complicate the findings. The investigations culminate in a final assessment of the location's paranormal activity, with teams sharing their conclusions and reflecting on the impact of the experience.",
