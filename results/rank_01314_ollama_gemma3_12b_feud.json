        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The first season of FEUD chronicles the escalating rivalry between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, beginning with their early careers and culminating in the production of 'Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?'. Initially, Davis, a seasoned star, views Crawford as a younger, less talented rival. Crawford, in turn, feels overshadowed by Davis's established reputation. As their careers evolve, their professional jealousy intensifies, fueled by studio manipulation and personal insecurities. The production of 'Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?' becomes a battleground, with both actresses vying for dominance and sabotaging each other's performances. The film's release and subsequent Oscar nominations further exacerbate their feud, leading to a bitter and protracted conflict that impacts their personal lives and careers. While the film achieves a degree of success, the actresses' relationship remains deeply fractured, leaving a lasting legacy of animosity and regret.",
