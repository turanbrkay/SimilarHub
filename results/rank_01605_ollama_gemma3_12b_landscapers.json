        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series initially presents Christopher and Susan Edwards as a peculiar couple living a quiet life in Devon, England. Their seemingly ordinary existence is shattered when it's revealed that they are suspects in the disappearance of William and Patricia Lin, whose bodies were discovered in the garden of a property they previously rented in Nottingham. The investigation unfolds through a dual timeline, alternating between the present-day police inquiry and flashbacks to the Edwards' past, gradually revealing the couple's troubled history and their involvement in the Lin's deaths. As the investigation progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that Christopher and Susan have constructed elaborate fantasies and narratives to cope with their trauma and evade responsibility. The series delves into the couple's dysfunctional relationship, their shared delusions, and the psychological factors that led to the tragic events. The truth about the murders is slowly pieced together, revealing a complex web of deception, manipulation, and repressed memories. The series culminates in a poignant exploration of the couple's motivations and the lasting impact of their actions, leaving the audience to question the nature of truth and the power of self-deception.",
