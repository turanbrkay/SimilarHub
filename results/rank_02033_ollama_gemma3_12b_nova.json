        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "NOVA's format eschews a traditional narrative arc, instead focusing on individual episodes that delve into specific scientific topics. Early episodes explored the history of science and technology, while later seasons tackled contemporary issues like climate change, genetic engineering, and the search for extraterrestrial life. Each episode typically follows a chronological or thematic progression, presenting evidence, interviewing experts, and illustrating complex processes through animation and real-world footage. While there are no overarching plotlines or character arcs, each episode builds a case for a particular scientific understanding, often challenging existing theories and prompting further investigation. The series consistently revisits and updates its coverage of key scientific advancements, reflecting the ever-evolving nature of knowledge.",
