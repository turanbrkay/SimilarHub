        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the Merriweather family, a notorious group of thieves and con artists, facing a crisis after a heist gone wrong. To evade authorities and escape a dangerous situation, they assume the identities of the wealthy Thorne family in the affluent suburbs of Louisiana. Initially, the Merriwethers, posing as the Thornes, struggle to adapt to the unfamiliar world of polo matches, charity galas, and polite conversation. However, they quickly discover that maintaining the facade is more challenging than they anticipated, as they encounter a complex web of secrets, rivalries, and personal dramas within the Thorne family and their social circle. As the Merriwethers delve deeper into their assumed identities, they begin to experience a degree of comfort and even affection for the lifestyle they are mimicking. However, their past inevitably catches up to them, threatening to expose their true identities and unravel the carefully constructed illusion.
