        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Sterling and Blair, seemingly typical high school students, discovering their mother's secret bounty hunting business. Eager to earn money and experience something beyond their privileged lives, they join forces with Bowser, a veteran bounty hunter, and begin taking on cases. Initially, their naivete and inexperience lead to humorous mishaps, but they quickly develop skills and a surprising aptitude for the work. As they delve deeper into the bounty hunting world, they encounter increasingly complex and morally ambiguous situations, forcing them to confront their own values and the consequences of their actions. The sisters' relationship is tested as they navigate conflicting loyalties and the pressures of their new careers, and they uncover secrets about their family and the wider community. The series culminates in a confrontation with a dangerous adversary, forcing the twins to rely on their wits and each other to survive, while also questioning the true meaning of justice and the impact of their choices.",
