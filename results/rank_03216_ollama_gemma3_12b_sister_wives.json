        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series initially follows Kody Brown, his first wife Meri, and their adopted daughter, Leon. They attempt to establish a life in Lehi, Utah, while navigating legal and social challenges related to polygamy. Soon after, Kody marries Janelle and Christine, expanding the family and the complexities of their relationships. The addition of Robyn, who also brings children, further alters the family dynamic and introduces new financial and emotional strains. Over the years, the family relocates to Las Vegas, seeking a more accepting environment. As the children grow, individual desires and ambitions create friction within the family unit. Relationships evolve, and legal marriages and divorces reshape the structure of the Brown family. The series chronicles the challenges of maintaining multiple romantic relationships, the financial burdens of supporting a large family, and the constant pressure to conform to societal norms while upholding their unique beliefs. The family experiences significant shifts in dynamics, with some marriages experiencing strain and eventual dissolution, while others attempt to adapt and redefine their roles within the evolving family structure.",
