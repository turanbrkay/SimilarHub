Among them are Amalia True, a mysterious, quick-fisted widow, and Penance Adair, a brilliant young inventor. They are the champions of this new underclass, making a home for the Touched, while fighting the forces of… well, pretty much all the forces — to make room for those whom history as we know it has no place.",

        "analytical_summary": "The Nevers is a Victorian-era science fantasy drama centered on a group of women in London who suddenly develop supernatural abilities, known as being 'Touched.' The series explores themes of social injustice, female empowerment, and the fear of the unknown as these women navigate a society that seeks to control or exploit them. With a blend of action, mystery, and a touch of steampunk aesthetic, the show offers a compelling narrative about belonging, prejudice, and fighting for a place in a world that doesn't want you. The series balances a sense of wonder with darker, more grounded themes of societal oppression and the struggle for survival.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the sudden appearance of the Touched, individuals manifesting extraordinary abilities across London. Amalia True, a widow with a mysterious past and a knack for quick-fisted action, and Penance Adair, a brilliant inventor, become protectors of this new underclass. They establish a haven for the Touched, facing opposition from various factions, including the Harriers, a group tasked with capturing and controlling the Touched, and powerful figures within Victorian society who fear their abilities. As the series progresses, the origins of the Touched are slowly revealed, hinting at a larger, more sinister force at play. Flashbacks reveal Amalia’s connection to the events surrounding the Touched’s emergence, and the true nature of her abilities. The Touched face escalating threats, including a mysterious figure known as the Nightingale, who targets them for unknown purposes. The series culminates in a confrontation where the Touched must unite to confront the forces threatening their existence, revealing a complex web of secrets and betrayals that reshape the landscape of Victorian London and the fate of the Touched.",
