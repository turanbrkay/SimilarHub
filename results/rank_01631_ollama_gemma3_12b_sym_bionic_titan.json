        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the crash landing of Princess Ilana, a refugee from her destroyed home planet, and the Sym-Bionic Titan, a colossal robot designed to protect her. She is found by Lance, a young, rebellious soldier, and together they work to keep the Titan's existence a secret from the public and the military. As they defend the town of Mountaintop from various threats – ranging from rogue military experiments to alien invaders – they forge a strong bond of friendship. Lance struggles with his duty and his desire for independence, while Ilana grapples with the responsibility of her heritage and the loss of her people. The Titan itself is a complex entity, capable of immense power but also vulnerable to manipulation. Throughout the series, the trio faces escalating challenges, uncovering deeper conspiracies and confronting powerful enemies who seek to exploit the Titan's abilities. While the series concludes with the immediate threat resolved, the underlying tensions and unresolved mysteries suggest a larger conflict yet to come, leaving the future of Mountaintop and the Titan uncertain.",
