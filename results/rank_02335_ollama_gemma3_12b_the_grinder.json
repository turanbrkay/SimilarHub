        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Dean Sanderson, a celebrated television lawyer, finds his career abruptly ended when his show, 'The Grinder,' is canceled. Believing his on-screen experience qualifies him, he returns to his hometown of Lemmon, Indiana, to join his family's law firm, which is run by his older brother, Mitch. Dean's arrival disrupts the established order, as his theatrical courtroom antics clash with Mitch's more grounded approach. Throughout the series, Dean struggles to prove his worth and reconcile his television persona with the realities of genuine legal work. He attempts to modernize the firm, often with disastrous results, and navigates complex family dynamics, including a strained relationship with his father and a budding romance. The series follows Dean's attempts to find his place within the family and the community, ultimately learning valuable lessons about humility, responsibility, and the importance of genuine connection. While Dean’s initial arrogance slowly diminishes, he continues to grapple with the shadow of his former television fame, and the series explores the challenges of transitioning from a manufactured reality to a more authentic existence.",
