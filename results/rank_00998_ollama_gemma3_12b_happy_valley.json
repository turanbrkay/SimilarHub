        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Catherine Cawood, a police sergeant, uncovering the identity of the man who sexually assaulted her daughter and took his own life. Years later, a new case involving the kidnapping of a young boy, Annas, draws Catherine back into the orbit of the man’s family, exposing a web of drug trafficking, violence, and long-held secrets. The investigation reveals a connection between Annas’s kidnapping and a large-scale drug operation run by the sinister DCI Neil Ackroyd.
