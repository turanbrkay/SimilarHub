        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins by introducing Charles Ingram, a former army major struggling to find his place after leaving the military. Driven by a desire to provide for his family, he participates in the British version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?. Initially, his performance is unremarkable, but he soon progresses through the questions with surprising accuracy. Unbeknownst to the audience and the show's producers, Ingram is aided by Tecwen Whittock, a fellow contestant who signals the answers using a cough code. His wife, Diana, is also involved, relaying the signals from outside the studio. The scheme appears successful until a member of the production team, Chris Tarrant, notices irregularities and alerts his superiors. An investigation is launched, leading to a highly publicized trial where Ingram, his wife, and Whittock are accused of conspiracy to defraud. The trial exposes the complexities of the case, revealing conflicting testimonies and raising questions about the integrity of the game show and the media's portrayal of the events. Ultimately, Ingram and his accomplices are found guilty, but the series leaves the audience questioning the fairness of the verdict and the true nature of the scandal.",
