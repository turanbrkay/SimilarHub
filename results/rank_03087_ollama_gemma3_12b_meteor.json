        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with a series of unexplained meteor fireballs impacting Earth, initially dismissed by the government as natural phenomena. Dr. James Rice, a renowned astrophysicist, believes these events are part of a larger, more dangerous pattern and attempts to alert authorities. He is joined by his assistant, Olivia, and a conspiracy theorist, Ben, who has been tracking the meteor activity for years. As they investigate, they uncover evidence of a government cover-up, suggesting that the government is aware of the impending disaster but is suppressing the information to avoid panic and maintain control. The trio faces opposition from government agents and powerful figures who are determined to silence them. Throughout the series, they work to gather irrefutable proof of the threat and expose the truth to the world, while simultaneously attempting to devise a plan to avert the catastrophic impact of the main meteor. The series culminates in a desperate attempt to warn the public and implement a last-ditch effort to mitigate the damage, leaving the fate of the planet hanging in the balance.",
