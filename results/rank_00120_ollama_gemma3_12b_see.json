        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Jerlamarel, a man who has lived his entire life in a tribe of blind people, discovering that his newborn twins, Kofun and Tamactiuk, can see. This revelation throws the tribe into turmoil, as their ability to see is considered a dangerous anomaly, threatening the established order and the queen's control. Jerlamarel, along with his wife Maghra, must protect the twins from the queen’s forces, who view them as a potential challenge to her reign. As the twins grow, they learn to navigate the world and harness their unique abilities, while also grappling with the responsibility that comes with their sight. The twins are separated and face different trials, encountering new tribes and learning about the history of the world before the blindness.
