        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The story begins in 1910s Korea, focusing on Sunja, a young woman who falls in love with a wealthy, married businessman, Koh Hansu. When she discovers she is pregnant, she is offered a marriage to a kind minister, Baek Isak, who takes her to Japan. This act of kindness sets in motion a chain of events that spans decades and impacts generations of her family. In Japan, Sunja and her family face discrimination and hardship as they struggle to build a life while maintaining their Korean heritage. The narrative then jumps forward to the 1980s, following Sunja’s son, Noa, who grapples with his identity and the secrets surrounding his parentage.
