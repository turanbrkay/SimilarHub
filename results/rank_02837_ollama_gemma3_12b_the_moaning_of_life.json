He’s unmarried, lacks children, and feels trapped in a job he dislikes. To force him to confront his existential angst, his friends send him on a journey around the world. Karl’s travels take him to various locations, each chosen to highlight different cultural perspectives on life, death, happiness, and purpose. He encounters diverse individuals and experiences, often reacting with his characteristic skepticism and bewilderment.
