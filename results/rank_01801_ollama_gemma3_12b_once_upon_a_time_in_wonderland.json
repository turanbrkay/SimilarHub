Rescued by the Knave of Hearts and the White Rabbit, Alice returns to Wonderland, a realm now under the tyrannical rule of the Queen of Hearts. The Queen, obsessed with maintaining order and power, has outlawed creativity and joy, and her reign is enforced by the Jabberwocky and a host of loyal subjects. Alice quickly discovers that Wonderland is far more complex and dangerous than she remembered, and that her past is inextricably linked to the current conflict. She joins forces with the Knave of Hearts, who is secretly plotting against the Queen, and other rebels, including the Mad Hatter, in an attempt to overthrow the Queen's oppressive regime. Throughout the series, Alice confronts her own inner demons and discovers hidden truths about her family and Wonderland's history.
