        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Mira, a celebrated American actress, seeking a change of pace and artistic challenge. She accepts a role in a remake of the French silent film 'Les Vampires,' portraying the enigmatic Irma Vep. As filming progresses, Mira finds herself increasingly consumed by the character, experiencing a gradual loss of her own identity. The production itself is chaotic, overseen by a demanding and eccentric director, René, who seems to manipulate events to push Mira further into the role. The line between Mira and Irma Vep becomes increasingly blurred, with Mira experiencing vivid hallucinations and questioning her own memories. The remake's narrative mirrors the original silent film, with a series of mysterious events and a sense of impending doom. As the filming nears completion, Mira's grasp on reality weakens, and she becomes entangled in a web of intrigue and paranoia, unsure whether she is acting or living a nightmare. The series culminates in a surreal and ambiguous finale, leaving the audience to question the true nature of Mira's transformation and the fate of the remake.",
