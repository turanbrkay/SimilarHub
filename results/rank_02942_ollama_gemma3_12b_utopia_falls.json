Initially captivated by this forbidden knowledge, the teens begin to question the colony’s carefully constructed reality and the narratives they’ve been taught. As they delve deeper into the archive, they realize that the colony’s leaders have deliberately suppressed information to maintain control. The teens begin to share the music and art from the archive, sparking a cultural awakening among the younger generation.
