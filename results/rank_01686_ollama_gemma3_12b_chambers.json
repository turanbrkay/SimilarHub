        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Vivianne Lowe receiving a heart transplant after a tragic accident. Initially, she experiences a sense of gratitude and renewed life. However, she soon begins to exhibit strange behaviors and memories that don't belong to her, seemingly mirroring the life and experiences of the deceased donor, Mitch. As Vivianne delves deeper into Mitch's past, she uncovers a history of mental illness, a troubled family, and a possible connection to a series of unexplained deaths. Her investigation is complicated by the reluctance of Mitch's family to share information and the growing suspicion that someone is manipulating her. The series reveals that Mitch was involved in a cult-like group with a dark history, and Vivianne's connection to him is far more profound than initially believed. The truth about Mitch's death and the nature of the group's influence becomes increasingly intertwined with Vivianne's own identity, blurring the lines between her past and the donor's. The series culminates in a confrontation with the forces behind the cult, forcing Vivianne to confront the darkness within herself and the legacy of the heart she now carries.",
