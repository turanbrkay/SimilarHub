        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Ross Poldark’s return from the American Revolutionary War, finding his life irrevocably altered. His father is deceased, his family’s mine is defunct, and his beloved Elizabeth is engaged to his cousin Francis. Ross’s attempts to reopen the mine and aid the struggling community are met with resistance from the powerful and corrupt George Warleggan, who seeks to exploit the region’s poverty for his own gain. Ross’s efforts to help the poor miners and their families lead him into conflict with the established order and attract the attention of Demelza Carne, a young woman he eventually marries. Throughout the series, Ross and Demelza face numerous challenges, including financial struggles, social prejudice, and the constant threat of Warleggan’s machinations. Elizabeth’s lingering affections for Ross create ongoing tension, and Francis’s character arc is marked by tragedy and regret. As the series progresses, Ross becomes a local hero, championing the rights of the common people and challenging the authority of the aristocracy, but his actions also bring him into dangerous situations and create lasting enemies. The series culminates in a complex web of relationships and conflicts, with the fates of the main characters hanging in the balance as they navigate a rapidly changing world.",
