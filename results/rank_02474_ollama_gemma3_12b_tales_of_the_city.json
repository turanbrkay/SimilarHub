        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Mary Ann Singleton, having built a seemingly successful life in Connecticut, returning to San Francisco after two decades. She’s driven by a desire to reconnect with her daughter, Lena, and her ex-husband, Brian, and to escape a growing sense of dissatisfaction. Upon her return, she is immediately drawn back into the vibrant world of 28 Barbary Lane, led by the wise and maternal Anna Madrigal. Lena, now a young adult, is navigating her own identity and relationships, often clashing with her mother's traditional values. Brian, still living in San Francisco, is grappling with his own personal struggles and the complexities of co-parenting. The series introduces a new generation of residents at 28 Barbary Lane, each with their own unique stories and challenges. As Mary Ann reintegrates into the community, she confronts unresolved issues from her past and witnesses the evolution of San Francisco's LGBTQ+ scene. The narrative explores themes of chosen family, generational differences, and the search for belonging, culminating in a sense of renewed connection and acceptance for all involved. While Mary Ann finds a measure of peace, the series acknowledges the ongoing struggles and uncertainties that define modern life.",
