        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Kick Buttowski, a young boy with a passion for daredevilry, attempting to join the local Daredevil Club, only to be repeatedly rejected due to his age and unconventional methods. Undeterred, Kick and his best friend, Gunther, form their own underground daredevil operation, documenting their stunts and challenges. Throughout the series, Kick faces opposition from his older brother, Brad, who represents a more conventional and cautious approach to life. He also contends with the challenges of balancing his daredevil pursuits with his family responsibilities and schoolwork. As the series progresses, Kick and Gunther's reputation grows, leading to encounters with rival daredevils and increasingly complex and dangerous stunts. While Kick never quite achieves his dream of joining the official Daredevil Club, he consistently proves his skills and ingenuity, inspiring others to embrace their own passions and take risks in a safe and creative way. The show culminates in Kick and Gunther facing their biggest challenge yet, requiring them to combine their skills and rely on their friendship to overcome a significant obstacle.",
