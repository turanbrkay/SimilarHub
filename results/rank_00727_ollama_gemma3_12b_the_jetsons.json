Centered around the Jetson family and their automated home, the series explores themes of family, technology, and consumerism through comedic situations. The show's lighthearted tone and futuristic setting provide a nostalgic and entertaining experience, appealing to audiences of all ages.

His children, Elroy and Judy, frequently encounter adventures with their robotic dog, Astro, and their friends. Recurring plotlines involve George's struggles to maintain his job, his interactions with the eccentric Mr. Spacely, and the family's attempts to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of their technologically advanced world.
