        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Patricia “Pat” Phelps, a once-successful novelist struggling with writer's block and a failing marriage, convincing her family to move from Chicago to the seemingly idyllic town of Shining Vale. They purchase a large, dilapidated house, unaware of its dark history – a series of gruesome murders that occurred within its walls. As Pat attempts to reignite her writing career, she begins experiencing increasingly bizarre and disturbing visions, blurring the lines between her depression and potential supernatural possession. Her husband, Mitchell, and their children, Gaynor and Robin, initially dismiss her concerns, attributing her behavior to stress and mental instability. However, as the supernatural occurrences escalate, they are forced to confront the unsettling truth about their new home and the malevolent forces at play. The series delves into the history of the house and its previous inhabitants, revealing a complex web of secrets and trauma. Pat's connection to the supernatural deepens, and she grapples with the possibility that she is becoming a conduit for the house's dark energy. The family's attempts to uncover the truth are met with resistance from the town's secretive residents, who seem to be protecting a sinister secret. The series culminates in a confrontation with the malevolent entity haunting the house, forcing the Phelps family to confront their own demons and fight for their survival.",
