        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with a botched robbery orchestrated by Zeke, a charismatic but volatile criminal, and his gang. His sister, Doris, is framed for the crime and left for dead, seemingly to eliminate a loose end. However, Doris survives and, fueled by rage and a desire for justice, embarks on a meticulously planned revenge campaign against Zeke and his crew. As Doris systematically dismantles Zeke's operation, she uncovers deeper secrets about her family's past and the true nature of the criminal enterprise she's infiltrating. Zeke, initially confident in his control, finds himself increasingly paranoid and vulnerable as Doris's actions disrupt his power and expose his vulnerabilities. The series explores the psychological toll of revenge on both Doris and Zeke, blurring the lines between victim and perpetrator. Ultimately, Doris confronts Zeke, leading to a final showdown that reveals long-held secrets and alters the dynamics of their fractured family.",
