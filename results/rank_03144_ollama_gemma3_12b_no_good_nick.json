Initially, the Thompsons are hesitant to embrace Nick, unsure of her true intentions and wary of her past. However, as they get to know her, they discover a resilient and surprisingly endearing young woman who has learned to survive on her own. Nick, in turn, finds a sense of stability and belonging with the Thompsons, something she has never experienced before. Throughout the series, Nick's past catches up to her, forcing the Thompsons to confront the consequences of their acceptance. While Nick's schemes often cause chaos, she also demonstrates a capacity for growth and a desire to make amends.
