        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Catherine Chandler, a young lawyer, witnessing a brutal attack and encountering Vincent, a man cursed to live as a beast. Vincent saves her life, and a unique bond forms between them. Catherine becomes Vincent’s protector and confidante, while he, in turn, helps her solve crimes and navigate the complexities of the legal system.
