Oliver is unwittingly drawn into a life of crime, and his innocence is constantly threatened by the dangers surrounding him. He is rescued by Mr. Brownlow, who believes him to be a lost child, but Oliver is soon recaptured by Fagin and his associates, including the menacing Bill Sikes and his volatile girlfriend, Nancy. As Oliver's true parentage is gradually revealed, a complex web of secrets and betrayals unfolds, involving a wealthy family and a long-lost inheritance.
