However, she quickly learns that altering the past has unforeseen and often negative consequences, creating ripple effects that complicate her present. As Erica continues to manipulate her timeline, she develops a complex and often adversarial relationship with Dr. Hanson, who attempts to guide her and prevent her from causing irreparable damage. Throughout the series, Erica confronts the underlying reasons for her regrets, learns to accept responsibility for her actions, and ultimately realizes that true growth comes from facing the past, not erasing it.
