        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series reunites the original Leverage team – Nathan Ford, Sophie Devereaux, Alec Hardison, Eliot Spencer, and Parker – who had previously disbanded. Ford, grappling with the loss of his son and a desire for atonement, brings the team back together to target individuals and organizations exploiting others for profit. The team is joined by Reina, a skilled hacker and corporate fixer, and Harry Dobney, a former IMF agent with a complex past. Each season sees the team tackling a new series of cases, often involving powerful corporations, corrupt politicians, and individuals profiting from human suffering. Throughout the series, the team members confront their own personal demons and past mistakes, leading to moments of vulnerability and growth. Relationships evolve, new alliances are forged, and the team faces betrayals and unexpected challenges as they navigate the morally ambiguous world of vigilante justice. While the team consistently succeeds in bringing down their targets, the consequences of their actions and the ever-present threat of exposure create ongoing tension and uncertainty.",
