        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with the sudden reappearance of Simon, who was presumed dead for twelve years. His return throws his family, particularly his sister, into turmoil as they struggle to reconcile the boy they knew with the young man standing before them. Soon, other individuals who were previously declared dead begin to reappear in the town of Borg, each return triggering a wave of confusion, fear, and hope. As the community attempts to understand the phenomenon, secrets from the past are unearthed, revealing complex relationships and hidden truths about the deceased. The returned individuals themselves grapple with fragmented memories and a sense of displacement, unsure of their place in the world.
