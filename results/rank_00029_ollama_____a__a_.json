        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "Season 1 opens with Johnny Lawrence reopening Cobra Kai, sparking a new rivalry with Daniel LaRusso, who has become a successful businessman and family man. Johnny’s return forces Daniel to confront his past while mentoring his son Miguel, who is drawn into the dojo’s aggressive training. Over the first two seasons, the series expands its cast with characters like Samantha LaRusso, a tough high‑school student, and the new Cobra Kai instructor, John Kreese, who returns to manipulate the dojo’s philosophy. The third season sees the original All Valley Karate Tournament revived, with Daniel and Johnny facing off in a high‑stakes match that ends in a dramatic draw, while Daniel’s daughter, Casey, becomes a central figure in the evolving power dynamics. Season four deepens the mentor‑mentee relationships, introducing a new generation of fighters and exploring the moral ambiguities of the Cobra Kai philosophy. In season five, the series culminates in a climactic showdown at the tournament, where the legacy of Miyagi and the future of the dojo are contested, leading to a bittersweet resolution that leaves the fate of Cobra Kai open for future exploration. Season six continues the narrative, further developing the characters’ personal journeys and the evolving balance between tradition and progress, while the series remains ongoing with no definitive conclusion announced.",
