        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Nick Fury and Talos investigating a series of unexplained events, quickly realizing that Skrulls have been secretly replacing key figures in positions of power across the globe for years. This infiltration was initially intended as a safe haven for displaced Skrulls following the events of Endgame, but has fractured into competing factions with differing agendas. One faction, led by Gravik, seeks to exploit the situation to instigate a war between Earth and the Kree, believing it will secure their dominance. As Fury and Talos work to uncover the extent of the Skrull presence, they encounter numerous betrayals and shifting alliances, realizing that those closest to them may not be who they seem. The conflict escalates as Gravik’s plans become clear, leading to a confrontation that threatens to plunge Earth into chaos. Ultimately, the Skrull threat is exposed, but at a significant cost, reshaping the geopolitical landscape and leaving lasting consequences for both Earth and the Skrull people.",
