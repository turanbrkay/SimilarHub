The series follows Joan Girardi, a young woman who begins receiving seemingly divine instructions from various individuals, leading her to question her sanity and purpose. The show explores themes of faith, free will, and the search for meaning in a chaotic world, often employing a whimsical and slightly surreal tone. It's a thoughtful exploration of belief and doubt, presented through the lens of a relatable teenager navigating everyday challenges.",
        "spoiler_rich_plot_summary": "The series begins with Joan's family relocating to Arcadia, where she starts receiving messages from people claiming to be God, each giving her specific tasks to perform. Initially bewildered and skeptical, Joan gradually begins to follow these directives, which often involve helping others and confronting personal issues. As the series progresses, Joan grapples with the implications of these encounters, questioning whether she is truly chosen or experiencing a psychological breakdown. Her relationships with her family, particularly her police officer father and her journalist mother, are strained as they struggle to understand her behavior. Throughout the series, Joan encounters various individuals who offer different perspectives on faith and spirituality, further complicating her search for answers. The series explores the impact of Joan's experiences on her community and the ripple effects of her actions, ultimately leaving her questioning the nature of her connection to the divine and her place in the world.
